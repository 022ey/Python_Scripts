Ethreum\u2019s (Ether) value has also increased by over 4 per cent to nearly $2,800. By 10:30 am, the price of Bitcoin had crossed $38,000.\n\nMuch of the reason behind the stabilisation in prices is higher inflows in the crypto market last week after hitting record outflows in the previous two, reported news agency Reuters on the basis of data from digital currency manager CoinShares.\n\nCryptocurrency highlights: Check Wednesday's prices and trends\n\nInflows in almost all cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Ether, have increased in the past week. The higher inflows last week seems to have helped reduce the wild price swings that gripped the crypto market over the past month.\n\nMeanwhile, popular meme-based currency Dogecoin surged yesterday after digital asset exchange Coinbase said it will make the crypto unit available to its users on its trading platform.\n\nDogecoin was up over 15 per cent at the time of writing this report and the digital coin's market capitalisation has jumped to over $55 billion.\n\nAll other popular cryptocurrencies including Ripple, Cardano, Chainlink, Stellar, Polkadot and Litecoin were trading higher.\n\nHere are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:\n\nCryptocurrency Price (US Dollar) 24-hour change Market cap (Billion) Volume (24 Hours) Bitcoin 37,900.19 3.28% $709.68 $30.95 billion Ethereum (Ether) 2,754.10 4.72% $319.83 $40.04 billion Dogecoin 0.426253 15.36% $55.30 $11.84 billion Litecoin 188.52 3.10% $12.78 $7.16 million XRP (Ripple) 1.03 1.86% $102.84 $3.97 billion Cardano 1.77 0.15% $56.95 $4.02 billion\n\nAnother positive news that has helped the cryptocurrency market gain is the fact that Standard Chartered PLC unit intends to establish a cryptocurrency brokerage and exchange platform in Britain and Europe to target institutional clients.\n\nThe new exchange will be created by a joint venture between SC Ventures, the bank's innovation arm, and BC Technology Group, which operates Hong Kong-licensed cryptocurrency exchange OSL.\n\nThe move is a strong endorsement of cryptocurrency from a mainstream lender and could pave the way for other global banks to follow suit.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s new platform will primarily target the European market, connecting institutional traders with counterparts trading Bitcoin, Ether and other digital assets, said the bank.\n\nWhile Standard Chartered\u2019s move is in sharp contrast to rival HSBC\u2019s stance on digital coins, it could be a turning point in the entire debate surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cWe have a strong conviction that digital assets are here to stay and will be adopted by the institutional market as a highly relevant asset class,\u201d Alex Manson of SC Ventures told news agency Reuters.\n\n(DISCLAIMER: The cryptocurrency prices have been updated as of 10:15 am and will change as the day progresses.

Virtual currencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which are collectively valued around $2 trillion, offer investors a way to shield income from tax authorities. In that way, the crypto economy contributes to the U.S. \"tax gap\" \u2014 the difference between tax paid and tax owed, according to the Treasury Department. The White House estimates a $7 trillion gap over the next decade. More from Personal Finance:\n\nBitcoin crash opens door to a tax loophole for investors\n\nSEC considers new investor protections for SPACs\n\nDebunking the myths about 529 college savings plans The Treasury seems particularly concerned about wealthy Americans who shift taxable assets into the crypto economy to avoid tax. \"Cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion,\" according to a Treasury report issued last week, which outlined the Biden administration's tax-compliance agenda.\n\nCrypto tax evasion\n\nBut just how does cryptocurrency lead to tax evasion? It largely comes down to lax reporting requirements, according to tax experts. The IRS may not be able to trace crypto income or transactions if they go unreported by exchanges, businesses and other third parties. And that means the income may not be taxed. \"No one has put out clear rules on it, so there's a lot of non-reporting going on,\" according to Jon Feldhammer, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former IRS senior litigator. \"Any time you create a path of non-reporting, you create a way to benefit from tax fraud in an untraceable or a much-harder-to-trace way,\" he said. Crypto is fast becoming an alternative to cash as more merchants accept bitcoin and other virtual currencies as payment. But cash is more heavily regulated.\n\nFor example, a business that receives more than $10,000 in cash from a customer must file a currency transaction report. This may happen if a consumer buys a car for more than $10,000 in cash, if someone wins big at the casino or if a bank receives a hefty cash deposit. These reports tell the government that a buyer has lots of money that may or may not be reported on a tax return. But the same rules don't apply to crypto. A used-car business that receives $20,000 of bitcoin from a customer doesn't have to file a currency transaction report; that income may also go untaxed if it's unreported on the business owner's tax return, Feldhammer said. \"Despite constituting a relatively small portion of business income today, cryptocurrency transactions are likely to rise in importance in the next decade, especially in the presence of a broad-based financial account reporting regime,\" the Treasury report said. Plus, virtual currencies don't have to be bought or sold through an exchange, making those transactions more opaque to government officials.\n\nBiden crypto proposal\n\nAl Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images", "Link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/31/cryptocurrency-poses-a-significant-risk-of-tax-evasion.html", "Authors": ["Greg Iacurci"], "Image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106890035-1622218863730-gettyimages-876199432-img_5316-5626.jpeg?v=1622218901", "Date": "31 May, 2021"}, {"index": 3, "Headline": "Coinbase rival Kraken launches mobile app in U.S. to capitalize on crypto surge", "Article": "Less than two months after Coinbase's stock market debut, rival crypto exchange Kraken is bringing its mobile app to the U.S. as retail investors flock to digital currencies.\n\nStarting Wednesday, the new Kraken App will allow many users across the U.S. to securely buy and sell more than 50 crypto tokens from their mobile phones.\n\n\"This consumer app is our first major foray into supporting wider consumer adoption in a much more simplified, easy-to-use interface,\" Chief Product Officer Jeremy Welch told CNBC.

There are inherent risks too with investments, and if you don\u2019t understand crypto coins as a concept, this can be complicated too. Chances are, you\u2019d be unable to fathom why there is so much volatility when it comes to crypto pricing. And if we are to factor in the scenario unfolding in India as we speak, banking institutions are adding to the complexity by simply refusing to play ball and support cryptocurrency investment apps and platforms. Many believe these will get resolved with time. If you are ready to take the risk, you can take the plunge and invest in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Polygon.\n\nWith the backdrop of the rising cryptocurrency excitement and awareness in India coupled with the banking troubles that a lot of cryptocurrency apps are reporting as well as reports that the Government intends to set up a panel of cryptocurrency experts as a first step towards regulating cryptocurrency in India, News18 spoke with Artur Schaback, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Paxful, a peer to peer (P2P) trading platform, who believes that despite the uncertainty, the expected panel of experts who will take the first step towards regulating crypto in India, is a cause to remain optimistic. Schaback also insists that the crypto investment has matured and no longer are investors afraid that the price will continue to fall.\n\nQ: How would you define cryptocurrencies and amidst all the jargon and tweeting, what would you want crypto followers to focus on?\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital currency or asset designed as a medium of exchange. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized systems of payment based on blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger technology that certifies records and transactions without the use of a central database. This decentralized structure allows cryptocurrency to exist outside the control of a central authority. What\u2019s most valuable is that cryptocurrency is a strong financial solution and can be used for things such as payments and e-commerce, wealth preservation, and investing. Also, by leveraging cryptocurrency within a peer-to-peer marketplace, consumers have access to practically any financial network in the world and are better enabled to gain financial freedom.\n\nQ: How do you see the cryptocurrency market developing in the next 12 months or so, particularly in India?\n\nDemand for cryptocurrency in India is rising. According to a recent IndiaTech.org report, Indian users currently hold cryptocurrency assets worth more than $1.5 billion and their daily trades in cryptocurrency are worth $350-500 million. I expect that interest and the use of cryptocurrency will only continue to grow \u2014 especially as the technology becomes more accessible to users and education around cryptocurrency becomes more prolific.\n\nQ: For crypto investors in India, how risky is it considering banks seem to be hesitant to engage with crypto trading platforms? Is there a risk of being locked out of the investment?\n\nThere is some uncertainty at this stage, but we remain optimistic, especially after hearing reports that the central government may form a fresh panel of experts to study the possibility of regulating cryptocurrency in India. There are several stakeholders involved in this conversation but we all want the same thing: to provide a strong financial solution for as many people as possible, one that is even more inclusive, robust, and safer for users.\n\nQ: Crypto startups in India have been facing challenges with banking support being pulled back. How much of a challenge will that be in the short term and long-term outlook?\n\nWe\u2019re optimistic that the traditional banking systems and the cryptocurrency companies will work together to strengthen the cryptocurrency industry. But for Paxful, unlike traditional crypto exchanges, users don\u2019t need a bank account to use Paxful. Our platform allows users to transact with almost 400 methods of buying and selling bitcoin including online wallets and gift cards.\n\nQ: How urgent is the need for a cryptocurrency panel in India? The government has talked about a calibrated approach.\n\nWe see the needs as urgent because education around cryptocurrency is vital. This move would help provide a fresh perspective and amplify understanding of the technology.\n\nQ: What are Paxful\u2019s plans for India and how big will the presence be in the country?\n\nCurrently, India is within Paxful\u2019s top five countries by volume. We have a strong user base in India and there\u2019s still huge untapped potential. We look forward to delivering to both our new and existing users in the country.\n\nQ: Investors looking for safe investments put their money in cryptocurrency? And if yes, which ones are the safer bets? Are there any safe crypto coins?\n\nWith every investment, there comes an inherent risk factor, whether you invest in mutual funds, stocks, or cryptocurrency. There\u2019s value in diversifying investment portfolios to mitigate this risk. Greater the volatility, the more the chances of earning a higher return investment. Volatility doesn\u2019t make any asset class ignorable.\n\nQ: Can some random tweets from Elon Musk set such a flutter in cryptocurrency markets or are there other factors at play?\n\nThe industry is still coming into its own. What\u2019s important to focus on is that when there is a great correction (a decline of 10% or more in the price of a security, asset, or a financial market), many investors are encouraged to buy. The market has matured in this regard and instead of being afraid that the price will continue to fall, people take the opportunity to invest. That is why the dip had a floor, sales always support the price.\n\nQ: Should investors Buy The Dip or is this more of a long term strategy once money is put in cryptocurrencies? What is the best time to invest in crypto?\n\nCryptocurrency has a variety of uses beyond speculation, from wealth preservation to remittance, payments and social good. Before someone invests in cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, it\u2019s important to determine what the need is for. Once they determine that, they can employ either a long-term or short-term approach to their investment. For either route, one strategy to consider is dollar-cost averaging (DCA), a strategy where the investor divides up the total investment and spreads it across different assets in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility.\n\nQ: How much money should one lock with cryptocurrencies?\n\nThe main mantra of investing is that people should invest as per their capability. Only invest what you are comfortable risking.\n\nQ: What Are NFTs and how do they tie in with cryptocurrencies? How are NFT valuations so high?\n\nAt a very high-level, a non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital asset verified using blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger technology that certifies records and transactions without the use of a central database. Valuations are high because NFTs are generally one of a kind and have unique identifying codes. This has contributed to its recent boom in popularity. NFTs are used as a means to buy and sell digital artwork, frequently with cryptocurrency, including images, songs, videos, and GIFs. As an example, Beeple, a digital artist, sold a NFT of his work titled \u201cEverydays: the First 5000 Days\u201d for $69 million earlier this year at Christie\u2019s, the British auction house.\n\nRead all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here", "Link": "https://www.news18.com/news/tech/indians-hold-cryptocurrency-assets-worth-more-than-1-5-billion-qa-with-paxful-3804800.html", "Authors": [], "Image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/06/1622696149_artur-schaback-paxful.jpg", "Date": "03 June, 2021"}, {"index": 6, "Headline": "A new cryptocurrency X-TOKEN to empower crypto-traders", "Article": "Baden-Wurttemberg, Stuttgart, May 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 29 May 2021 - Cryptocurrency exploded in popularity over the past few months and is the hottest new trend in the investing world.

The token was launched with the idea of creating a community token with a self-generating income mechanism for its owner.\n\nX-TOKEN differs from the rest of the De-Fi crowd because it has a passionate team working full time to develop a fully-fledged ecosystem of applications surrounding the token. \u201cWe aim to not only have a financially appealing cryptocurrency asset for short-term traders but a suitable long-term asset for serious long-term investors active in crypto. X-TOKEN is a yield-generating contract that rewards its holders\u201d Company stated.\n\nEach trade has a 10% tax whereas 5% gets distributed to holders and another 5% gets locked in liquidity to create a solid price floor. Buying X-TOKEN is easy in a few steps: Download wallet, get BNB on Binance which you can swap to X-TOKENS, Swap on XSwap, which is also their first dApp, or on PancakeSwap.io.\n\nThe team behind X-TOKEN consists of 5 members who are experts in cryptocurrency from the early stages.

Crypto has seeped into pockets all over our society and you had a confluence of events -- a combination of Tax Day, Elon Musk tweets, whatnot, where you started breaking down the positivity in the price action, and now we've got a liquidation event,\" longtime bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nInstitutional support retreats\n\nPart of the reason for bitcoin's weakness seems to be at least a temporary reversal in the theory of broader acceptance for cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, Musk announced he was buying more than $1 billion of it for his automaker's balance sheet. Several payments firms announced they were upgrading their capabilities for more crypto actions, and major Wall Street banks began working on crypto trading teams for their clients. Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange company, went public through a direct listing in mid-April.\n\nHowever, Musk announced last week that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns. He did suggest on Wednesday that Tesla is not selling its existing bitcoin holding, using emojis on Twitter to say the company has \"diamond hands.\" And Coinbase, which surged above $400 shortly after its first trade on April 14, quickly gave up those gains and was down near $220 per share on Wednesday morning. Its direct listing date is also the day of bitcoin's most-recent all-time high. Additionally, a new report from JPMorgan said that, based on futures contracts, institutional investors appeared to be moving away from bitcoin and back to gold. Bitcoin is often touted as a potential replacement for the traditional metal as a store of value.\n\nA risk-off trade?\n\nThe weakness is not isolated in crypto, suggesting that the moves could be part of a larger rotation by investors away from more speculative trades. Tech and growth stocks, many of which outperformed the broader market dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic, have also struggled in recent weeks.\n\nThe Ark Innovation ETF, a fund of high-growth stocks led by star fund manager Cathie Wood, is down more than 30% from its February highs. As of Wednesday morning, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has fallen 6.9% from its most recent closing high on April 26. The small cap Russell 2000 is down 5.6% over the same period. The declines have also coincided with the delayed deadline for tax payments, which could have caused selling pressure as investors looked for cash to pay off capital gains tax liabilities.\n\nRegulatory concerns\n\nBitcoin and related assets have also come under increased scrutiny from regulators around the world as they have grown into a bigger part of the financial markets. \"We believe government crackdown on cryptocurrencies can trigger another 'crypto winter' and reduced trading activity. Harsher crackdown on crypto is possible in many developing countries which may view crypto as a threat to their fiat currencies and monetary system,\" Bernstein's Harshita Rawat said in a note Tuesday. China, which is developing its own government-run cryptocurrency, reasserted its rules against other digital currencies on Tuesday, banning financial companies from providing services for crypto trading. In the U.S., newly appointed Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said earlier this month that he thought regulators should be \"technology neutral\" but more consumer protection is needed in crypto markets.", "Link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/the-crypto-collapse-heres-whats-behind-bitcoins-sudden-drop.html", "Authors": ["Jesse Pound"], "Image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106885587-16214575182021-05-19t203912z_144465080_rc28jn9cpt2v_rtrmadp_0_crypto-currency-bitcoin.jpeg?v=1621457768", "Date": "19 May, 2021"}, {"index": 11, "Headline": "Bitcoin 2021: World\u2019s Largest Cryptocurrency Conference Coming To Wynwood", "Article": "MIAMI (CBSMiami) \u2013 On Wednesday, crews were putting the final touches on the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, the world\u2019s largest-ever crypto-currency conference to be held this weekend at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood.\n\n\u201cWe could not be happier. Happier that organizers of the Bitcoin 2021 Conference have chosen the city of Miami\u201d, said Miami Mayor Francis Suarez who held a virtual international crypto conference Wednesday morning.\n\nDuring the virtual conference, Mayor Suarez alluded to his 4-word tweet from months ago, which grabbed the attention of the crypto industry.\n\nOn camera, Suarez stood up showing a t-shirt, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d Suarez said, \u201cIn the past 6 months since that tweet, we have seen an unprecedented amount of companies, technologists, and investors choose to move Miami.\u201d\n\nMiami\u2019s crypto conference is expected to draw 50,000 people.\n\nThe convention runs from Friday, June 4 through June 6th.\n\nThe conference places Miami firmly in the landscape as the new Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cMiami is becoming the new capital of capital.

PayPal is simply a transfer of fiat currency, whereas bitcoin or athereum are its own kind of currency.\u201d\n\nCrypto is like gold, it can be invested. However, it can\u2019t be manipulated or counterfeited and it\u2019s immune to inflation.\n\nHarris said, \u201cIt\u2019s considered a capital asset. It\u2019s taxed the same way any long-term or short-term asset is taxed. If you hold it for less than a year it\u2019s subject to short-term capital gains. If you hold it longer than a year, it\u2019s subject to long-term capital gains.\u201d\n\nThe currency has been used by terrorist groups such as Hamas, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHarris admits until crypto is regulated, that\u2019s a downfall of crypto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beauty and the risk associated with it. It does not require the approval of a bank. It does not require the approval of a government.

In early trading on Monday bitcoin fetched $38,477, up 12% from the previous day, according to Coindesk.com.\n\nThe extreme volatility that has marked bitcoin's emergence in recent years was on full display when its price plunged as much as 29% earlier this month after financial regulators in China banned domestic banks and other financial institutions from supporting bitcoin. That includes processing payments, allowing customers to hold bitcoin in their accounts and converting bitcoin into yuan or any other currency.\n\nSuch roller-coaster swings in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which have also been buffeted of late, is raising questions about their risks as investments and viability as financial assets. Here's what you should know.\n\nWhat happened to the price?\n\nA on May 18 statement posted on the Chinese Banking Association's website said financial institutions should \"resolutely refrain\" from providing services using digital currencies because of their volatility.\n\nVirtually every cryptocurrency fell after the industry group's statement. Bitcoin slumped to $30,202 before recovering to $38,038, down 12% on the day, according to Coindesk. Most cryptocurrencies lost between 7% and 22% of their value and shares of Coinbase dropped 5.4%.\n\nAnd China isn't the only country clamping down on cryptocurrencies. Many banks in the Middle East are also barred from dealing in bitcoin, while U.S., regulators appear to be leaning toward more actively monitoring cryptocurrencies. On Thursday, the Treasury Department said it would require businesses to report any bitcoin payment over $10,000, citing an effort to crack down on tax evasion.\n\nThe value of bitcoin can change by thousands of dollars in a short time period. On the last trading day of 2020, bitcoin closed just under $30,000. In mid-April, it flirted with $65,000. The price bounced around after that, with some notable swings, before taking a decidedly negative turn last week.\n\nHow bitcoin works\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who \"mine\" them by lending computing power to verify other users' transactions. They receive bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies. Some businesses take bitcoin as payment, and a number of financial institutions allow it in their clients' portfolios, but overall mainstream acceptance is still limited.\n\nBitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators \u2014 and criminals.\n\nBitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Coinbase, or offline on a hard drive using specialized software. According to Coinbase, there are about 18.7 million bitcoins in circulation and only 21 million will ever exist. The reason for that is unclear, and where all the bitcoins are is anyone's guess.\n\nDoesn't Elon Musk have a role here?\n\nYes, and a fairly big one. Musk announced in February that his electric car company Tesla had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin. In March, Tesla began accepting bitcoin as payment. Those actions contributed to the run-up in bitcoin's price, and Musk also promoted the digital currency Dogecoin, which also spiked in value.\n\nHowever, Musk reversed course in just a short time, saying last week that Tesla would stop accepting bitcoin because of the potential environmental damage that can result from bitcoin mining. The announcement sent bitcoin falling below $50,000 and set the tone for the big pullback in most cryptocurrencies.\n\nA number of bitcoin fans pushed back on Musk's reasoning. Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban said that gold mining is much more damaging to the environment than the mining of bitcoin.\n\nA 2019 study by the Technical University of Munich and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the bitcoin network generates an amount of CO2 similar to a large Western city or an entire developing country like Sri Lanka. But a University of Cambridge study last year estimated that on average, 39% of \"proof-of-work\" crypto mining was powered by renewable energy, primarily hydroelectric energy.\n\nBut some companies are using bitcoin?\n\nThe digital payment company Square and its CEO Jack Dorsey \u2014 also the CEO of Twitter \u2014 have been big proponents of bitcoin. Overstock.com also accepts bitcoin, and in February, BNY Mellon, the oldest bank in the U.S., said it would include digital currencies in the services it provides to clients. And Mastercard said it would start supporting \"select crypto currencies\" on its network.\n\nBitcoin has become popular enough that more than 300,000 transactions typically occur in an average day, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. Still, its popularity is low compared with cash and credit cards.\n\nThere is skepticism around bitcoin?\n\nYes, plenty of it. Tracking bitcoin's price is obviously easier than trying to figure out its value, which is why so many institutions, experts and traders are skeptical about it and cryptocurrency in general. Digital currencies were seen as replacements for paper money, but that hasn't happened so far.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank prefers to call crypto coins \"crypto assets,\" because their volatility undermines their ability to store value, a basic function of a currency.\n\nWhile some banks and financial services companies are getting in on it, others are staying away.\n\nCould a digital currency selloff cause broader economic damage?\n\nRegulators aren't very worried about a possible crash in digital currencies dragging down the rest of the financial system or economy.\n\nEven with the recent sell-off, digital currencies have a market value of about $1.5 trillion, according to the website coinmarketcap.com. But that pales compared with the $46.9 trillion stock market, $41.3 trillion residential real estate market and nearly $21 trillion Treasury market at the start of the year.\n\nThe European Central Bank said Wednesday that the risk of cryptocurrencies affecting the financial system's stability looks \"limited at present.\" In large part, that's because they're still not widely used for payments and institutions under its purview still have little exposure to crypto-linked instruments.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Reserve said a survey of market contacts found roughly one in five cited cryptocurrencies as a potential shock to the system over the next 12 to 18 months. That's a turnaround from the fall, when a similar survey found none mentioning cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow much oversight is there?\n\nWashington officials have been talking about regulating digital currencies more, and worries about a heavier hand have played a role in the recent swoon in prices.\n\nGary Gensler, who took over as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, has said that cryptocurrency markets would benefit from more oversight to protect investors.\n\nIn a hearing before the House's financial services committee earlier this month, Gensler said neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which he used to head, has a \"regulatory framework\" for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges yet. He said he thought Congress would ultimately have to address it because \"there's really not protection against fraud or manipulation.\"\n\nHow bitcoin came to be\n\nIt's a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn't matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.\n\nIn 2016, An Australian entrepreneur stepped forward and claimed to be the founder of bitcoin, only to say days later that he did not \"have the courage\" to publish proof that he is. No one has claimed credit for the currency since.", "Link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crypto-price-bitcoin-down-2021-05-24/", "Authors": [], "Image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/05/19/8edc83f1-a9ea-4f02-b48e-0adb30b98046/thumbnail/1200x630/19382be932428563d70d738adcbe7e9a/2021-05-19t203900z-541777464-rc28jn928g9j-rtrmadp-3-crypto-currency-bitcoin.jpg", "Date": "24 May, 2021"}, {"index": 15, "Headline": "Cryptocurrency scams on the rise, impact felt in Lowcountry", "Article": "The Dorchester County Sheriff\u2019s Office is warning about a phone scam from someone claiming to be with Dominion Energy.

It's been a rude awakening for bitcoin investors who thought they could handle the crypto volatility. The world's largest digital currency suffered a 30% one-day drop last Wednesday, falling to about $30,000 apiece. Just in mid-April, bitcoin hit a record high of $64,829. The turbulence was dramatic even by crypto's standards. The last time bitcoin saw a decline of this magnitude was March 2020 at the height of the Covid pandemic. And even then, the trading wasn't as jarring. Bitcoin has experienced 14 down days in May alone, according to Coin Metrics. So far this year, there have been 39 days with daily swings of 5% or more in either direction, based on bitcoin's closing prices.

Traders taking excessive risk in the unregulated cryptocurrency market being forced to sell when prices go down were in large part responsible for last week's 30% drop in prices and outages for major exchanges, according to analysts. A burgeoning bitcoin lending market is also adding to the volatility. The price of cryptocurrencies tanked last week, with bitcoin losing roughly a third of its value in a matter of hours. Bitcoin popped to nearly $40,000 on Monday but is still down about 33% from its high.\n\nWhen traders use margin, they essentially borrow from their brokerage firm to take a bigger position in bitcoin. If prices go down, they have to pay the brokerage firm back in what's known as a \"margin call.\" As part of that, there's often a set price that triggers selling in order to make sure traders can pay the exchange back. Brian Kelly, CEO of BKCM, pointed to firms in Asia such as BitMEX allowing 100-to-1 leverage for cryptocurrency trades. Robinhood does not allow traders to use margin for cryptocurrency, and Coinbase only allows it for professional traders.\n\n\"You get this crowd factor \u2014 everybody's liquidation price tends to be somewhat near everyone else's-- when you hit that, all of these automatic sell orders come in, and the price just cascades down,\" Kelly, told CNBC. Bitcoin traders liquidated roughly $12 billion in levered positions last week as the price of the cryptocurrency spiraled, according to bybt.com. This mass exodus wiped out about 800,000 crypto accounts. \"Selling begets more selling until you come to an equilibrium on leverage in the system,\" said JMP analyst Devin Ryan. That selling begins to \"compound\" as leveraged positions are liquidated, because they can't meet those margin requirements, he said. \"Leverage in the crypto markets \u2014 particularly on the retail side \u2014 has been a big theme that accentuates the volatility,\" Ryan added. As the crypto market expands, Ryan said he expects leverage to become less of an influence, especially as more institutional capital comes in. Investors, both retail and institutional, have poured into bitcoin and other digital assets in 2021. The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 Coinbase \u2014 said trading volume in the first quarter of the year was $335 billion, of which approximately $120 billion was retail and $215 billion was institutional. Trading volumes totaled about $30 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Mark Cuban weighed in on the leverage aspect for ether, the world's second largest cryptocurrency, on\n\nTwitter last week. \"De-Levered Markets get crushed. Doesn't matter what the asset is. Stocks. Crypto. Debt. Houses. They bring forced liquidations and lower prices. But crypto has the same problem that [high-frequency traders] bring to stocks, front-running is legal, as gas fees introduce latency that can be gamed,\" Cuban said in a tweet last week.\n\nLending\n\nThe other behind-the-scenes cause for selling may have come from the growing bitcoin lending market. Crypto companies such as BlockFi and Celsius allow bitcoin holders to store their crypto with the firm, in exchange for an interest rate of between 6% and 8%. On the back end, those firms lend bitcoin out to hedge funds and other professional traders. They also allow people to use their bitcoin holdings as collateral for loans. For example, if someone took out a $1 million loan backed by bitcoin and the price drops by 30%, they may owe 30% more to the lender. \"As you hit a certain collateral level, firms will automatically sell your bitcoin and send the collateral to the lender,\" BKCM's Brian Kelly said. \"This adds to the massive cascade effect -- there was so much volume that most of the exchanges broke.\"\n\nRegulation", "Link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/bitcoin-crashes-driven-by-big-margin-bets-new-crypto-banking.html", "Authors": ["Kate Rooney Maggie Fitzgerald", "Kate Rooney", "Maggie Fitzgerald"], "Image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105496652-1539107947284gettyimages-917296340.jpeg?v=1611325226", "Date": "25 May, 2021"}, {"index": 25, "Headline": "China to hand out $6.2 million in digital currency to Beijing residents as part of trial", "Article": "A digital Chinese currency red packet is seen on a mobile phone in an arranged photograph as Chengdu city starts to distribute 200,000 E-CNY 'red packets' worth 40 million yuan on February 24, 2021 in Yichang, Hubei Province of China.

But it also means the network is constantly using energy \u2014 a sticking point for many of the cryptocurrency's skeptics and critics. And it's not just a bitcoin problem. Other cryptocurrencies and blockchains including Ethereum have similar challenges.\n\nThe debate about bitcoin's environmental impact was elevated earlier this month when Tesla CEO Elon Musk, once one of the most notable bitcoin boosters, said his company would no longer accept it for the purchase of vehicles. He cited the use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining as a reason.\n\nIt's an issue that some blockchain evangelists think they can solve \u2014 and potentially open the door to more widespread adoption of the technology.\n\n\"It's a fundamental breakthrough for humanity, we can now do things that we could not do otherwise,\" said Danny Ryan, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, of decentralized computer systems and blockchain technology. \"When humans find new tools they use them. So this decentralized thing, this crypto thing, it's not going anywhere, but there's also a much better way to do it.\"\n\nThe better way is called proof of stake. And for some cryptocurrencies, it's already in use.\n\nProof of work\n\nTo understand the implications of proof of stake, it's important to first detail the way bitcoin currently works: a system called proof of work.\n\nThe idea for bitcoin is generally recognized to have emerged out of a white paper published in 2008 by an anonymous author who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It laid out the idea for proof of work, in which separate parties take on the task of verifying the records and transactions stored in a blockchain.\n\nThe system is entirely decentralized, meaning that many computers from all over the world participate in the blockchain verification process. The underlying code of the bitcoin system governs the process, rather than any central authority.\n\nIn order to participate, bitcoin miners need to use specially constructed computers and have access to a lot of energy. Currently, those computers are in short supply but in high demand. At their core are specialized computer chips and semiconductors, both of which are in a global shortage that has already affected the manufacturing of automobiles, laptops and smartphones.\n\nThe decentralized network of specialized computers, called \"rigs\" or \"mining rigs,\" works hard to solve very complex mathematical equations. By solving the equation, they verify that the blockchain is accurate. People who participate in this verification process are called miners and they are rewarded for their efforts in the form of cryptocurrency, in this case, bitcoin.\n\nThe process is energy intensive. In order to verify that the record is accurate, so-called bitcoin miners expend a significant amount of computing power. The miners verifying the records are then rewarded for their expenditures with bitcoin.\n\nThe security of the system is built into the enormous amount of computing power that is required to run it. In order to hijack the records, an entity would have to contribute over half of the total computing power. In the case of bitcoin, this would be prohibitively expensive and, due to the shortage of hardware, is not feasible.\n\nAnd so, any cryptocurrency built on a proof of work protocol is going to be plagued by, as Musk put it, \"insane\" energy demands as it scales larger. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, a part of the Cambridge Judge Business School, found that bitcoin uses about 110 terawatt-hours per year, which is similar to what Malaysia and Sweden use.\n\nProof of stake\n\nProof of stake takes a different approach to security by ensuring trust in a more old-fashioned currency: money.\n\nTo participate in the blockchain verification process in proof of stake, users create a node, that node can be run by one person or by a pool of people working together. You can think of a node as a computer. The node is required to prove its trustworthiness by locking away a certain amount of crypto coins, the same type generated by the blockchain they are verifying. Imagine putting a deposit in escrow or locking it in a security bond. This process of locking away is called staking.\n\nFor each block of transactions that needs to be verified, one node is selected by an algorithm that takes many factors into account to both reward those with more coins staked and prevent one node from getting too much control over the process. That node is responsible for checking and publishing or adding the block to the chain.\n\nThen all the other nodes get some time to make sure that everything looks good. If there is a mistake or fraud, the node that published the problematic block is punished by having some or all of their staked coins destroyed. But if everything looks good, that node is rewarded with more coins. This is both the security mechanism for the blockchain and the motivator for participation.\n\n\"Instead of buying a bunch of hardware and burning a bunch of energy, I can instead take that asset and lock it in kind of like a security bond,\" said Ryan, the researcher at the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nBecause the basis of proof of stake doesn't require any extra energy to prove trustworthiness, it is much more energy efficient. Unlike in proof of work, where specialized computing equipment like high-end graphics cards are needed, the proof of stake protocol can be run off of a laptop. The nodes are virtual spaces, not physical equipment.\n\nAs a result, participating in the \"mining\" process has a much lower barrier to entry, meaning that more people can participate in the process. And given that a core principle of cryptocurrency is decentralization, having more people participating in securing the blockchain helps secure the whole system.\n\nThe whole process uses marginally more energy than a computer would if it was just on. Researchers like Ryan believe that the result is that energy consumption for proof of stake is 99.99 percent lower than proof of work.\n\nIn practice\n\nProof of stake is already working. Cardano uses proof-of-stake and has the fourth-largest market capitalization \u2014 $50 billion \u2014 of any cryptocurrency as of mid-May. It is currently the most significant proof of stake cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nCardano surged after Musk tweeted about ending the program to allow people to buy Teslas with bitcoin due to energy efficiency concerns, which sent nearly every other cryptocurrency into steep declines. It has since followed suit and plummeted.\n\nOther already functioning cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake include Polygon, Tezos, Polkadot and EOS.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest potential impact of proof of stake is a project called Ethereum 2.0.\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency and has become more popular over the past year as investors have looked to diversify their portfolio away from bitcoin. And at its core, Ethereum is designed to be a versatile platform for an emerging concept called decentralized finance, or the use of smart contracts to automate many financial transactions that today require middlemen.\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum is also run by proof of work, but since its inception, founder Vitalik Buterin envisioned a transition to proof of stake. At the launch of Ethereum, the community agreed to set aside 430,000 ether coins to fund the Ethereum Foundation, a registered nonprofit in Switzerland. That is now equal to about $1 billion. The foundation has supported the community through grants in an effort to move toward the more energy efficient Ethereum 2.0, but in the spirit of decentralization is not leading the way.\n\n\"There's hundreds of people that work on this project,\" said Ryan, who is one of the few researchers employed by the foundation. \"The EF certainly plays a kind of coordination role, and has tried to help facilitate and keep things moving. But I would say it's certainly not centralized.\"\n\nIt is complicated to switch Ethereum to proof of stake. The engineers working on the project have to build and test the proof of stake engine and have it run parallel to the existing system, which continues to run on proof of work. This portion has already begun to slowly come online.\n\nOnce the proof of stake engine is completely online, it will run for some time while bugs are worked out. Then, when the kinks are fixed, the community will ideally come to a consensus and set a time for the swap to happen. Users of the platform and people who hold ether won't be affected; all the changes will happen on the backend. At that moment, the energy usage of the platform is expected to drop by 99.99 percent, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nRyan says the goal is to get this done in 2021, but cautions that 2022 is also fairly likely. And there have been delays before.\n\n\"This is no joke. The Ethereum network is hundreds of billions of dollars, with tens of thousands of people using this platform all the time, and increasingly so,\" he said. \"And so doing it fast is important but doing it safe is more so.\"", "Link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cryptocurrency-goes-green-proof-stake-offer-solution-energy-concerns-rcna1030", "Authors": ["Ezra Kaplan", "Ezra Kaplan Is A Producer For Nbc News."], "Image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2021-05/210517-crypto-farm-jm-1520-e71f96.jpg", "Date": "01 June, 2021"}, {"index": 28, "Headline": "Can cryptocurrency survive regulators? Here's what Ripple CEO says about XRP's future", "Article": "In this article XRP.BS=\n\nXRP.CM=\n\nKnown for pioneering cryptocurrency XRP, Ripple has been caught in a high-stakes legal tussle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since last year. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse doubled down on his frustration surrounding the lack of clarity in U.S. regulation of digital assets in an appearance on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday. He says a big part of the problem with crypto regulation in the U.S. is not the cryptocurrency players, but the lack of action from the U.S. regulators compared to global peers. The SEC charged Ripple, co-founder Chris Larsen and Garlinghouse with conducting an illegal securities offering that allegedly raised more than $1.3 billion through sales of XRP. XRP was trading up about 8% on Wednesday morning amid a crypto rebound, and it is up more than 300% year-to-date, but has fallen far from its YTD high during the recent crash in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin had bounced back from its massive, recent decline and was hovering around $40,000 on Wednesday. \"There's a misunderstanding of how these technologies can be applied,\" Garlinghouse said. \"In the United States there has been a lack of regulatory clarity. Other countries, G20 markets, they have invested the time and energy, either through legislation or rulemaking, to provide that clarity and certainty, which allows investors to participate, entrepreneurs to build.\" Ripple ranked No. 38 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.\n\nFights between the crypto industry and regulators are ongoing \u2014 on Wednesday, the U.K. banned an advertisement advising people to buy bitcoin calling it \"irresponsible.\" An opinion article in the Wall Street Journal this week called for a ban on crypto and cited issues like hackers using cryptocurrencies to get paid for cyberattacks like the recent Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident. This year's No. 1 CNBC Disruptor company, Robinhood, says in the first quarter of 2021, 9.5 million customers traded crypto on Robinhood Crypto, compared to 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nRipple's on-demand liquidity service uses XRP as a kind of \"bridge\" between currencies, which it says allows payment providers and banks to process cross-border transactions much faster than they would over legacy payment rails. Despite this month's return of crypto volatility \u2014 bitcoin is still down more than 32% this month for its worth monthly decline since 2018 \u2014 it and other tokens like XRP surged to new heights this year. Ripple owns most of the XRP tokens in circulation and sells a tiny fraction of its holdings each month. \"XRP is an open-source technology very analogous to bitcoin,\" Garlinghouse explained. \"But the SEC is making the assertion that these are investment contracts ... that Ripple sales of XRP to our customers is actually an investment contract. That isn't true. If you buy XRP, you don't have ownership of Ripple and ironically you have XRP owners who have tried to sue the SEC for even bringing the case.\"\n\nBitcoin, energy use and Elon Musk", "Link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/can-crypto-survive-regulators-heres-what-ripple-ceo-says-about-xrp.html", "Authors": ["Riley De Le\u00f3n"], "Image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105624742-1544683311895gettyimages-951165762.jpeg?v=1544683371", "Date": "26 May, 2021"}, {"index": 29, "Headline": "Cryptocurrencies bounce back after sell-off \u2013 here\u2019s what market analysts are saying", "Article": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies bounced back Thursday, recovering some of the losses seen during a major sell-off a day earlier.\n\nExperts give their thoughts on what that fall in the cryptos means for the future of the space.\n\nDavid Rubenstein, co-founder and co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, remains optimistic.\n\n\"I think it's here to stay. Cryptocurrency is not going away, just like gold is not going away. Yes, it's had its ups and downs and [Wednesday] was not a good day for it but that's true of anything that is relatively new. \u2026 It's here because people in the market want something other than just the traditional currencies that we've had and whether that's right or wrong, it's clearly something that the market wants.\"\n\nMore education will lead to less volatility, said Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks.\n\n\"I would argue the problem is as much educating investors about this stuff as it is about building infrastructure because I think we're at a point in time where many investors don't know the difference between ethereum and filecoin and solana. They just all see it as crypto and you wouldn't buy stocks that way. So, I think we need to focus more on what these tokens represent, what the network value is that is backing them and when we have that level of education, you're going to see some amount of the volatility go away.\"\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, discusses how bitcoin will bounce back.\n\n\"The bull market is intact for bitcoin. If you go back over the different slides in bitcoin over the last 12 years, this is consistent with those slides. Having said that, you had a very big run-up at the beginning of the year because of all the expectation but \u2026 most of the smaller players are using tremendous amounts of leverage. Think of the GameStop situation. \u2026 So long term, bitcoin is bouncing back, I think that's a flight to quality in the crypto space but if you look at the altcoins I think it's good for crypto and ethereum because they really got blasted.\"\n\nJim Cramer, host of CNBC's \"Mad Money,\" gives his take on the \"hidden\" aspect of bitcoin trading.\n\n\"I think the main concern is how hidden it is. Now I know blockchain is terrific in giving it the power of being hidden but the lack of regulation is causing the IRS to be unsure, you have to check all the boxes of whether you did bitcoin. \u2026 This is not a meme, this is a major business.\"\n\nRich Repetto, managing director at Piper Sandler, said volatility is to be anticipated.\n\n\"Expect volatility in these cryptocurrencies. What happened over the past few days. while painful, it's not unusual with how crypto has been priced over the last 10 years. You've seen every year, at least a 28% drop and you've seen three solid cycles of resetting prices. Coinbase is tied to and totally focused on the crypto economy, so we'd expect the stock to reflect some of that volatility as well.\"\n\nSean Horgan, equity research analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, weighs in on the positive aspects of volatility.\n\n\"Volatility is not all bad for an exchange, right? When there's more volatility, there's more engagement, more MTUs, monthly transaction users, there's more trading volumes and that means more revenue, so I actually don't think it's all negative in the short term and it's certainly not in the long term.\"\n\nIan Balina, founder and CEO of Token Metrics, said volatility also means upside potential.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies, one of the beauties of them is that they're very volatile but as a result of that there's lots of upside. Lots of retail investors and traders are joining the space because of the huge gains whether in bitcoin, whether in ethereum, dogecoins or meme coins but at the end of the day they should zoom out and have a big-picture view. Because right now bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are building the future of finance, the future of open money and if they have that big picture then they should huddle and think long term. We think bitcoin is great technology, but we think bitcoin's days are almost over because bitcoin was designed to be digital cash but now it's just becoming purely a store of value, it's becoming digital gold.\"\n\nMaciej Ceg\u0142owski, founder of Pinboard, called it out as a pyramid scheme.\n\n\"My bear case is that it's a giant pyramid scheme. And people are getting sucked into it. Unfortunately, it's a pyramid scheme that has a core of true believers and a core of people that are really fascinated by technology, so it becomes difficult. It also has a group of very smart investors and all kinds of people who are heavily pouring money into it, so it becomes difficult to call it out. But I think it's very necessary to call it out because in the end, like every pyramid scheme, people are going to get hurt\"\n\nDisclaimer", "Link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/20/cryptocurrencies-bounce-back-after-sell-off-what-market-analysts-are-saying.html", "Authors": ["Marcelle Owona"], "Image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106800765-1606130262265-gettyimages-872670764-set04375-bitcoin_9nov2017_kw0618.jpeg?v=1621541661", "Date": "20 May, 2021"}, {"index": 30, "Headline": "Cryptocurrency crunch is 'a great opportunity to buy,' trader says amid slew of negative catalysts", "Article": "Cryptocurrencies collapsed Wednesday, with bitcoin plunging as much as 30% in a single session amid regulatory pressures overseas and negative headlines on the home front.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC's \"Trading Nation,\" New Street Advisors Group founder and CEO Delano Saporu said that \"for investors that are thinking long term, this is actually a great opportunity to buy at prices you may not see for a while.\"\n\nHe looked back on the history of bitcoin, citing its last major correction in 2017.

This means that you won\u2019t have any protection if things go wrong.\n\nMyron Jobson, personal finance campaigner for Interactive Investor, told The Sun cryptocurrencies are \u201cnotorious for wild price swings\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not uncommon for the value of cryptocurrencies to quickly fall by hundreds.\n\n\u201cThe yo-yo-ing price of the asset is simply too much for many investors to stomach.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies, and those involved in the space, remain highly speculative and should only be a tiny portion of a portfolio \u2013 whatever your risk appetite is.\n\n\u201cIt is important to approach new cryptos with extreme caution.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also being warned about other new cryptocurrencies, such as shiba inu coin.\n\nIn January, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority warned that households risk losing ALL of their money if they invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe value of bitcoin and ethereum crashed a few weeks ago after China announced a further crackdown on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis story was first published on The US Sun and is reproduced with permission", "Link": "https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/what-is-mina-investors-warned-about-wild-price-swings-in-new-cryptocurrency/news-story/58febfafefc8e918c61b7303a441f94c", "Authors": ["Alice Grahns", "The Us Sun"], "Image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3cdce5065b62670d47089ab4a4b0d958?width=1280", "Date": "02 June, 2021"}, {"index": 36, "Headline": "Comptroller candidate Reshma Patel talks cryptocurrency", "Article": "NEW YORK \u2014 Aiming to become the city\u2019s top financial officer, Democrat Reshma Patel on Wednesday evening defended proposing a small portion of the city\u2019s pension funds be invested in cryptocurrencies, arguing some states have seen success with such a move.\n\nIn an interview with \u201cInside City Hall\u201d Anchor Errol Louis on Wednesday night, Patel, a candidate for city comptroller who was once a financial advisor for the office, urged the trustees of the New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Systems to allocate between 1 to 3% of their assets into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nPatel cited success stories from pension funds in other states that adopted similar cryptocurrency strategies, while positioning the investment as a hedge against inflation or a potential downturn in traditional stock markets.\n\n\u201cThere are two pension funds in Virginia which had invested in a blockchain fund two years ago and then they increased that because the returns had done well,\u201d Patel said.\n\nWhile Patel acknowledged the volatility of cryptocurrency markets, she countered that traditional stock markets also see periods of relatively high risk, too.\n\n\u201cI understand there\u2019s risk \u2014 especially in the last few weeks there\u2019s been tremendous risk in this \u2014 but last March we had a lot of risk in the S&P [500] as well,\u201d Patel explained.\n\nPatel also vowed to expand the city\u2019s digital banking efforts, specifically in vulnerable, low-income communities, in order to ensure all New Yorkers have access to financial services.

Bitcoin , the largest cryptocurrency, traded around $43,300 on Tuesday, putting its market cap at roughly $800 billion, according to data from Coin Metrics.\n\n\"Investors need to find return streams that can hedge debasement risk and be a diversifier of equity risk at higher levels of inflation. These assets [cryptocurrencies] might have the potential to perform that function,\" the firm said Tuesday in a note to clients.\n\nThe total value of the cryptocurrency market now stands above $2 trillion, putting it on nearly equal footing with the amount of gold held for private investment purposes, according to a new report from Bernstein.\n\nCrypto bulls have long championed bitcoin as a modern-day replacement for gold, and by one measure, the new market is already close to surpassing bullion in that respect.\n\nBut Bernstein was quick to note that both gold and digital currencies have other uses. When gold jewelry is thrown into the equation, the precious metal's market worth is closer to $8 trillion, by Bernstein's calculations, making it roughly four times the size of the crypto universe.\n\nAdditionally, there are important differences between cryptocurrencies. Bernstein said bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value, while other digital currencies such as ethereum have functionality beyond being held as an investment.\n\nBernstein's call echoes comments from large money managers who have pointed to the ease with which bitcoin is traded as potentially making it more attractive than gold as a safe haven asset and hedge against inflation.\n\n\"It's easily transportable and can be sent anywhere in the world if you have a smart phone, so it's a much better version, as a store of value, than gold,\" Bill Miller, founder and chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, told CNBC in April.\n\n\"It [bitcoin] is so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,\" noted Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock.\n\nStill, questions remain around bitcoin's long-term viability, including from regulatory and environmental standpoints. Last week bitcoin prices dropped after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company was suspending accepting the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for vehicles due to the \"rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining.\" Musk later clarified on Monday that the company has not sold any of its bitcoin position, which was first revealed in February as worth $1.5 billion.\n\nLooking forward, Bernstein's Harshita Rawat said she believes bitcoin can displace gold once some of the regulatory and environmental questions are answered.\n\n\"Bitcoin can more easily be used as a store of value in any part of world (especially in countries with unstable fiat currencies) and is very liquid,\" she noted, pointing to the cryptocurrency's 24x7 network and near instantaneous transactions. \"The implications as a store of value, particularly in certain countries/regimes, are significant.\"\n\nShe said bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally have \"reached a tipping point\" in terms of \"institutional/retail adoption, dollar investments, talent working in the industry and liquidity.\"\n\nThat said, Rawat's colleague Inigo Fraser-Jenkins is less certain about how investors will ultimately view bitcoin over the long term. Among other things, he pointed to gold's 5,000-year history, compared to investors only recently viewing bitcoin as able to retain its value.\n\nHe argues that it will be many years before bitcoin can establish enough widespread trust to make it a true safe-haven asset. \"There are very broad economic, legal and cultural issues at play here.

Source: NYSE\n\nThe trading pattern of the past two weeks \u2013 particularly alongside cryptocurrency's movements \u2013 suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead. Investors are watching the wild swings in bitcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week. The Dow and S&P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix. A steep plunge in bitcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on bitcoin mining and trading. \"What's interesting is the market is being bullied around by where bitcoin goes,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. Bitcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday. The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics. \"Bitcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,\" said Boockvar. \"It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we're getting dragged along by bitcoin.\"\n\nThere is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday. But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed's preferred inflation measure. \"The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,\" said Boockvar. \"What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.\" The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March. In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.\n\nNo correction yet\n\nAs the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains. Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.\n\n\"For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,\" said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. \"In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback. Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. \"You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,\" he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.\n\nTech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%. The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155. The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%. \"It wouldn't shock me if we went straight back to new highs,\" Knapp said. \"Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.\" He said earnings for the S&P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began. Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy. \"Last cycle, we had eight of those,\" he said. \"Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.\" Knapp said it's natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. \"It's an uncertainty shock,\" he said. \"It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.\" Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit. The bitcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. \"The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,\" he said, noting bitcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.\n\nWeek ahead calendar", "Link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html", "Authors": ["Patti Domm", "In"], "Image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106882214-16208517468072-SMWB-OB-Photo-210512-PRESS-24-jpg?v=1620851806", "Date": "21 May, 2021"}, {"index": 39, "Headline": "Cryptocurrency Related Scams Flood Tribunals in Spain \u2013 Bitcoin News", "Article": "Cryptocurrency Related Scams Flood Tribunals in Spain\n\nSpain has not been a stranger to the popularity of cryptocurrencies, and with this popularity, also comes the attention of people and organizations wanting to capitalize on the subject. Spanish tribunals have been flooded lately with lawsuits involving cryptocurrency scams related to bitcoin and ethereum based platforms, and the people using these to scam other users for millions of euros.\n\nCryptocurrency-Related Scams Flood Tribunals in Spain\n\nTribunals from Spain are now being flooded with cryptocurrency scam-related cases, that are affecting thousands of citizens, according to local reports. With the recent price increase of cryptocurrencies, scammers are always looking to do a quick buck, and they have been successful in Spain. One of the biggest scams reported is the one associated with a company named Algorithms Group, which scammed more than 280 million euros from 300+ investors.\n\nThe brain behind this scam is a man called Javier Biosca, who acted as a broker buying and selling cryptocurrencies and offering weekly interests of 25% per investment. However, the business went sour quickly and Biosca disappeared with the money of investors. Emilia Zaballos, the lawyer that is representing private investors, states the scam could have affected 4,000 people. She stressed:\n\nAmong those affected are people of all kinds. From notaries, lawyers, national police, businessmen, to tax inspectors and even judges. But also domestic workers, retirees, and the unemployed. And great fortunes.\n\nNimbus, another investment-based Ponzi scheme, is estimated to have defrauded 136 million euros from more than 4,000 investors in the country. The company, which also operated internationally, offered returns to investors for their deposits in cryptocurrencies. Other important companies that are facing similar trials are Kuailian and Arbistar 2.0, Ponzi schemes that also face money laundering charges.\n\nMore Organization Is Needed\n\nEmilia Zaballos, the lawyer that is in the Algorithms Group case, states that more organization is needed for facing this kind of scam schemes affecting more citizens each day. She is now pushing for the establishment of new courts just for attending this kind of crypto-related crimes, and for more guidance from the established institutions when dealing with these structures. Till now, national regulators limit their actions to alert investors about the possible dangers of using these investment tools, but they haven\u2019t exerted any direct actions against them.\n\nBut she is not just waiting for action. Zaballos is the president of an organization called \u201cAsociaci\u00f3n de Afectados por Inversiones por Criptomonedas,\u201d that groups the users affected by these organizations and helps them execute legal actions against them.\n\nWhat do you think about the rise of cryptocurrency scams in Spain?

The firm tabled those plans initially and restarted the crypto trading team in March, Reuters reported earlier this year. Thursday's memo was the first time New York-based Goldman officially acknowledged its involvement in crytpocurrency trading.\n\nUnder CEO David Solomon, Goldman has said it is seeking to broaden its market presence by \"selectively onboarding\" crypto trading institutions to expand offerings.

Cryptocurrency is not going away, just like gold is not going away,\" the Carlyle Group co-founder and co-chairman said, adding some investors see bitcoin as a substitute for gold.\n\nRubenstein's comments Thursday came one day after a hugely volatile day for bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and a host of other digital assets. The entire crypto market saw hundreds of billions of dollars of value wiped out after bitcoin plunged more than 30% at its lowest point Wednesday to around $30,000 per token. Bitcoin later recovered some of those losses and traded back up over $41,000 on Thursday.\n\n\"It has its ups and downs, and yesterday was not a good day,\" Rubenstein said, referring to Wednesday's collapse. \"But that's true of anything that is relatively new, and I don't think you're going to see anything like crypto going away and disappearing. It's here.\"\n\nBitcoin and other digital coins traded off their session highs after the Treasury Department on Thursday called for stricter cryptocurrency compliance with the IRS.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, shared Rubenstein's view around volatility, saying later on \"Squawk Box\" that bitcoin's plunge Wednesday was hardly a historic anomaly. \"I think the bull market is intact for bitcoin. If you go back over the different slides in bitcoin over the last 12 years, this is consistent with those slides,\" Scaramucci said.\n\nSome people remain skeptical of bitcoin, even as Rubenstein and a range of other high-profile investors tout its long-term viability. For example, Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said earlier this month that the \"whole damn development\" of bitcoin is \"disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.\"\n\nRubenstein said that whether people think bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are \"right or wrong,\" it's clear that there's an appetite for an alternative to the current financial system. \"It's here because people in the market want something other than just the traditional currencies that we've had,\" he said.\n\n\"If you go into cryptocurrencies, you should expect big ups and downs and big fluctuations. If you're not prepared for that, don't go into cryptocurrency,\" added Rubenstein, who co-founded Carlyle in 1987 after serving in the Jimmy Carter administration.\n\nFor crypto investors, one lingering question is whether the U.S. government will step up its regulation of digital assets. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler, who is new to the role, told CNBC earlier this month that he believes \"we need greater investor protection\" around bitcoin.\n\n\"To the extent that something is a security, the SEC has a lot of authority. And a lot of crypto tokens \u2014 I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment \u2014 are indeed securities,\" Gensler said May 7 on \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nRubenstein weighed in on the prospect of more regulation, saying the idea that \"the government is going to be able to stop cryptocurrency from being something investors want is unrealistic at this point.\"", "Link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/20/david-rubenstein-says-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin-are-here-to-stay.html", "Authors": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"], "Image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104653933-IMG_6594a.jpg?v=1547144222", "Date": "20 May, 2021"}, {"index": 48, "Headline": "Cramer says he owns 'a lot' of red-hot cryptocurrency ether that's tripled bitcoin's 2021 gain", "Article": "CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday he owns ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.\n\n\"I've got a lot of ether,\" Cramer said on \"Squawk Box,\" explaining he initially acquired it in order to bid on nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, being auctioned in March by Time magazine. \"I didn't get it, so I just kept the ether.\"\n\nWhile Cramer did not specify exactly when he bought ether, the digital currency entered March at about $1,400 and rose to around $1,900 by the end of the month.

The adoption of online payments using crypto is growing too, thanks to brands ranging from legacy publisher (and NextAdvisor partner) TIME to digital payment facilitator PayPal and international auction house Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nYou may be wondering what to make of cryptocurrency and whether it has a place in your portfolio. But if you\u2019re not familiar with digital currencies or blockchain technology, even the basic concept can be overwhelming.\n\nHere\u2019s our guide to crypto, and why so many people are talking about it these days.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is a type of currency that\u2019s digital and decentralized. Cryptocurrencies can be used to buy and sell things, and their potential to store and grow value has also caught the eye of many investors.\n\nThere are thousands of different cryptocurrencies available today. The most popular \u2014 and the original \u2014 is Bitcoin, which was created in 2009. Other common cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, XRP, and Bitcoin Cash. Each of these currencies serves a different purpose, with some optimized for use in place of cash, and others designed for private, direct transactions.\n\nCryptocurrencies are wholly digital, so there\u2019s no physical coin or bill connected to the crypto you own. Instead, owners hold cryptocurrency in a digital wallet, and buy or sell through an online exchange. Your wallet may be online (some popular exchanges like Coinbase offer an in-app wallet) or stored offline on a hardware device similar to a USB drive.\n\nDecentralization is a primary tenet of cryptocurrency. Whereas most currencies are backed by a central bank \u2014 the U.S. dollar, for example, is backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the U.S. government \u2014 cryptocurrencies are maintained and valued by their users.\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger. This ledger is called a blockchain. Every time crypto is bought or sold, the transaction is added to the blockchain \u2014 a public database of the transactions, which is available to other crypto holders. Anyone can join and participate in the blockchain, but data on individual transactions \u2014 and the people involved with them \u2014 are secured using cryptography (the basis for the term cryptocurrency). For each transaction added to the blockchain, there\u2019s a digital validation process to verify it and prevent fraud.\n\nWhat Can You Do With Cryptocurrency?\n\nWhile it shares characteristics of both currency and investments, there\u2019s still debate among experts about whether cryptocurrency is clearly one or the other.\n\nAs its name suggests, you can use cryptocurrency to make purchases. But your purchasing power is limited; crypto isn\u2019t yet widely accepted among retailers and other businesses.\n\nThat lack of widespread adoption, plus crypto\u2019s volatility, limits its use as a currency, says Roger Aliaga-D\u00edaz, principal and senior economist with Vanguard Investment Strategy Group.\n\nFor many people, crypto is a type of alternative investment. Just as you can buy and trade stock in public companies, you can buy cryptocurrency with the hope that it will increase in value over time, allowing you to cash out for a profit at a later date. Some people invest in crypto less for the belief that it will become a popular currency and more as a bet on the blockchain technology behind it.\n\nBut classifying crypto as an investment is complicated, too. It doesn\u2019t quite fit the mold of a traditional stock or bond, and while cryptocurrencies do share characteristics of commodities like gold \u2014 they can be bought and sold for cash and as derivatives based on expected future value \u2014 they have no inherent physical value or use.\n\nWithout a clear track record to assess long-term value, cryptocurrency rises and falls on an unpredictable demand cycle. And for individual investors, the challenge is \u201cyou really don\u2019t know where supply and demand can end up,\u201d Aliaga-D\u00edaz says.\n\nSimilar to forex \u2014 foreign exchange \u2014 trading, there can be significant risks involved with a largely unregulated market, and your best bet is to get informed beforehand, and don\u2019t invest any money you can\u2019t afford to lose. Regulators are still trying to figure out how to classify cryptocurrencies, for purposes of trading, payments, antifraud, taxation, and more. Clear regulation may help us understand how to use cryptocurrency and what its future may look like, but we aren\u2019t there yet.\n\n\u201cWhere digital assets land, at the end of the day \u2026 will be driven in part by regulation, both domestic and international,\u201d Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton recently told CNBC.\n\nWhat Are the Cryptocurrency Terms You Should Know?\n\nBlockchain: A blockchain is a type of database in which a cryptocurrency\u2019s digital transaction records are stored in groups, or blocks. New blocks are continually created as extensions of the previous block, forming a chain. These blockchains build upon themselves within the database, storing an ever-increasing amount of data about the transactions for a specific cryptocurrency.\n\nA blockchain is a type of database in which a cryptocurrency\u2019s digital transaction records are stored in groups, or blocks.

Many exchanges offer digital wallets.\n\nIs Crypto Safe?\n\nThe blockchain technology backing cryptocurrency is inherently secure, thanks to the decentralized \u2014 and public \u2014 nature of distributed ledger technology and the encryption process every transaction undergoes.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely secure in the same way most people consider the U.S. dollar or other established currencies to be secure. Since cryptocurrency isn\u2019t backed by any governmental authority, it doesn\u2019t have the same protections as many standard currencies throughout the world.\n\nUnlike the money you save in a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), \u201cIf a virtual currency company fails \u2013 and many have \u2013 the government will not cover the loss,\u201d the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warned in a 2014 notice about cryptocurrency (its most recent guidance).\n\nThe CFPB names more specific risks that consumers should be prepared for, including volatile exchange rates, potential high fees on exchange platforms, and fraud risk. If your funds are lost or stolen, they can be especially difficult to recover, thanks to the decentralized nature of blockchain and lack of any governmental oversight.\n\nAnd, importantly, just because cryptocurrency is secure does not make it safe. As much as some of the recent popularity of cryptocurrency is driven by investors\u2019 belief in its value, that value is still based on speculation. For those who invest in crypto, it will be among the riskiest investments they make.\n\n\u201cI believe everyone should have a diversified portfolio,\u201d says Daniel Johnson, a financial advisor and founder of RE|Focus Financial Planning in Asheville, North Carolina. Any investment you make should be appropriately weighted against the rest of your portfolio as well as the overall market. Just as you wouldn\u2019t invest all your money in one company, it\u2019s unwise to put every dollar you have into crypto.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Cryptocurrency?\n\nBitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies\u2019 values have skyrocketed in recent years. Bitcoin\u2019s price has more than doubled in 2021, and Ethereum has more than quadrupled in value this year.\n\nBut whether that growth is sustainable, and what it means long-term, is still in question. \u201cThis crypto, blockchain technology, the public interest in it right now is being driven by a kind of speculative fever,\u201d says Dr. Richard Smith, executive director of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, a nonprofit organization dedicated to studying recurring patterns throughout economies and cultures.\n\nStill, an increasing number of big, powerful players are validating crypto\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cEvery single day, the concept that it could be worth something, it could be a store of value is being continually approved by more large, powerful entities,\u201d Johnson says, pointing to established financial institutions holding digital currencies and large corporations adding them to their corporate balance sheets. \u201cThe idea that it\u2019s actually worth something is continuing to grow as adoption and acceptance continues to grow as well.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the future of cryptocurrencies \u2014 their value, security, and staying power \u2014 is still up in the air. But the experts we spoke to believe owning some crypto could create value over time. Whatever your interest or motivation, experts stress the importance of making sure you understand the unique volatility and risk factors of cryptocurrency before investing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to keep your eyes open,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cDon\u2019t get the FOMO at a fever, because it\u2019s very volatile. No one should invest anything that they can\u2019t afford to lose, and that\u2019s the same advice I give for any kind of an investment.\u201d", "Link": "https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-cryptocurrency/", "Authors": ["Kendall Little", "May"], "Image": "https://time.com/nextadvisor/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/na-what-is-cryptocurrency-1000x630.jpg", "Date": "12 May, 2021"}, {"index": 50, "Headline": "As cryptocurrency goes wild, fear grows about who might get hurt", "Article": "\u201cWhy is this happening now; culturally, where are we?

That means the rate at which a cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another currency can fluctuate vastly since the design of many cryptocurrencies ensures a high degree of scarcity.\n\nBitcoin bulls have called it a \u201cstore of value\u201d \u2013 which has historically been reserved for safe-haven investments like gold \u2013 and argue that it\u2019s a good investment to hedge against inflation.\n\nThat's because there\u2019s not an unlimited supply of bitcoin.

It eclipsed $3,900 on Saturday to touch another all-time high, rising more than 400% in 2021.\n\nEther supply, however, isn't capped and new tokens are created through a similar mining process as bitcoin.\n\nA screengrab from the dogecoin.com website. One of the Dogecoin founders told a cryptocurrency news site that the token's rise makes him worry about market excess. dogecoin.com\n\nThe \"memecoin\" Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a joke poking fun at the surge in other digital coins. Dogecoin was inspired by the popular Doge meme, which is an image of a Shiba Inu dog staring sideways at the camera with raised eyebrows.\n\nThe latest surge has pushed Dogecoin\u2019s market capitalization to $62 billion, which means it\u2019s valued more highly than Ford and Twitter. In 2021, it has surged from less than half a penny to a record of nearly 75 cents. It's currently trading just below 50 cents.\n\nWhat cryptos aren't\n\nCryptocurrencies aren't a currency supported by governments, and they aren't a piece of a company, like a stock. But the factors that determine their underlying worth are unclear, experts say.\n\nFor those who invest in a stock, the price of a share should be the present value or future profit that a company is going to generate, according to Itay Goldstein, a professor of finance and economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.\n\nItay Goldstein, a professor of finance and economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business No one can tell you whether bitcoin priced at $50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 is too much or too little.

The crypto market is highly volatile and we do not recommend any particular cryptocurrency.\n\nIt's pretty easy to find out what the top cryptocurrency is at any given time: it's been Bitcoin for years now and that's unlikely to change soon. However, the market below it moves very quickly, which can make it hard to keep up with all of the various altcoins.\n\nHowever, it's important that you do know about them, because investing in cryptocurrency can be a risky business. The crypto market is far more volatile than traditional stocks, with some coins growing in value swiftly, then dropping just as rapidly. Bitcoin, for instance, rose from $45,000 in March to a high of $63,000 in mid-April \u2014 then plunged to $35,000 in May.\n\nIf you do decide to buy cryptocurrency, a good piece of advice is never to spend more than you can afford to lose. Calculate the effect on your investment if the coin you owned were to fall by 20%, 50% or even 80% overnight and weigh up whether you could afford to hold on in the hope that values rose again, or if you'd be tempted to sell at a loss.\n\nThat said, even if you're not thinking of investing, cryptocurrency is a fascinating subject.\n\nWhile we all know about Bitcoin, there are hundreds, if not thousands, or other cryptocurrencies. Many are alternative \u2014 supposedly improved \u2014 versions of Bitcoin, but others, like Ethereum, Cardano and Chainlink, are much more than just a currency. And then there's Dogecoin, which started off as a joke but is now one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, plus other \"memecoins\" such as Shiba Inu coin.\n\nIn our guide to the top cryptocurrency performers, we outline the stories behind some of the key cryptos to be aware of, plus their current value, latest news and more.\n\nDogecoin climbed to its highest value for two weeks on the back of the news that it will this week be listed on the Coinbase Pro exchange. At one point today it reached $0.43 and is currently up by 20% in the past 24 hours.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's 2022 budget proposal includes several new crypto reporting requirements, according to Coindesk.\n\nApple is recruiting for a person with cryptocurrency experience to work on \"Alternative Payments.\"\n\nWhat is the top cryptocurrency by value?\n\nSo, which is the top cryptocurrency right now? One approach is to look at market capitalization \u2014 essentially the total dollar value of a company's shares of stock. And in that regard, it's hard to see beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have sizable leads over their respective competition.\n\nYou can also look at the price of an individual cryptocurrency share, or coin, which is useful for knowing how well (or otherwise) a crypto is performing, but it doesn't always tell the full story. So we're sticking with market cap for this guide to the top cryptocurrency performers right now.\n\nThat said, many of the other crypto projects listed below are super interesting and certainly worth looking further into. And with new cryptocurrencies such as SafeMoon and Chia springing up seemingly every day, we'll be updating this top cryptocurrency list regularly.\n\nHere are all the top cryptocurrencies (by market cap as of June 2).\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nBitcoin market cap: $706.1 billion\n\nBitcoin value: $37,757\n\nThe Bitcoin story: Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and is the blue chip cryptocurrency. It has, by far, the largest market cap, the highest coin value, and the largest network of users.\n\nBitcoin was created by an unknown person or group who goes by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. It was supposed to be the cash of the future, and although you can use it today to purchase many goods and services, you wouldn\u2019t use it to buy a cup of coffee because the cost of the transaction would be too high.\n\nThink of Bitcoin instead like the gold of the future: not really useful for daily transactions, but you want to have some for its stored value. It\u2019s also like gold in that it has a limited supply, which is one of the things that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors: a total of 21 million Bitcoins will ever be released, which makes Bitcoin inflation-proof.\n\nBitcoin performance history: Like all cryptos, Bitcoin started out worth virtually nothing. In 2017 it took off from under $1,000 to over $20,000, but within a year was down around $4,000. In late 2020 it began skyrocketing again, this time from around $10,000 to a high of more than $60,000, before dropping in the past few weeks, mostly due to various Elon Musk tweets. It's currently worth around $37,700.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin: Bitcoin can be purchased on crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken; at Bitcoin ATMs; on PayPal; and on Robinhood. Don\u2019t be put off by the high price of a coin: you can invest as little as $25 in Bitcoin on Coinbase.\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\n(Image credit: Filippo Ronca Cavalcanti/Shutterstock)\n\nEthereum market cap: $317.5 billion\n\nEther value: $2,731\n\nThe Ethereum story: If there is another contender for the top cryptocurrency title, it's Ethereum. But it doesn\u2019t compete with Bitcoin. It\u2019s important to note that many so-called cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t straight-up currencies like Bitcoin. Some, like Ethereum, are instead unique technologies that also have a coin component. In Ethereum\u2019s case, its currency is called Ether, and it can be used in applications run on the Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum is the leader in what\u2019s known as these \u201csmart contract\u201d platforms. While Bitcoin was created for one use case \u2014 as a currency \u2014 Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2015 with bigger and broader ambitions. The blockchain it runs on is programmable, meaning it can run programs, or apps, in a decentralized way, i.e., on millions of computers at once. This opens up many possible use cases, from technology and finance to gaming and collectibles, making Ethereum an attractive investment.\n\nIt's also worth noting that a new version of Ethereum is coming soon. Among other things, Ethereum 2.0 will reportedly by 99.95% more environmentally friendly than the current model.\n\nEthereum performance history: In the past year, Ethereum\u2019s price has shot up from around $200 to well over $3,000. In fact, it recently passed $4,000 for the first time in early May and reached an all-time high of more than $4,350 recently, but has fallen sharply recently and currently stands at around $2,700.\n\nHow to buy Ethereum: You can buy ETH on the major crypto exchanges, Robinhood, and PayPal.\n\n3. Binance Coin (BNB)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nBinance Coin market cap: $62.1 billion\n\nBinance Coin value: $404.9\n\nThe Binance Coin story: Binance Coin was launched in 2017 by the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, the world\u2019s largest crytpo exchange by volume. During its initial coin offering (ICO), it sold 100 million coins to the public at $0.15 per coin. Binance Coin can be used to pay transaction fees on the Binance exchange, to trade for other cryptocurrencies, and to pay for some goods and services. Every quarter, Binance uses 20% of its profits to buy back and destroy Binance Coins. This will continue until Binance buys back and destroys 50% of the total supply, making its coin scarcer and therefore more valuable.\n\nBinance Coin performance history: Since launching in 2017, Binance Coin has made a long, slow climb to about $60 a coin, before shooting upwards in February 2021 and reaching more than $600 at one point. As with virtually all of the top cryptocurrencies, it suffered a major fall recently; it's currently trading in the $375 range.\n\nHow to buy Binance Coin: The best place to buy, sell, trade, and hold Binance Coin is Binance\n\n4. Tether (USDT)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nTether market cap: $61.7 billion\n\nTether value: $1\n\nThe Tether story: Tether is unique among the options in our top cryptocurrency list: it's the leader in the category of cryptocurrency known as \u201cstable coins.\u201d Why stable? Because they are pegged to a traditional currency, in this case the US dollar.\n\nFor investors, these tokens offer the joint benefits of open blockchain technology and traditional currency. Tether was launched in 2015 and operates on the Ethereum platform. USD Coin is another stable coin, and many crypto folks think it\u2019s a safer bet than Tether, citing a greater transparency.\n\nTether performance history: One Tether token = one USD. Always has, always will.\n\nHow to buy Tether: Buy, sell, and use Tether tokens at Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and other major crypto exchanges.\n\n5. Cardano (ADA)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nCardano market cap: $56.4 billion\n\nCardano value: $1.76\n\nThe Cardano story: Cardano, founded in 2017, is another Ethereum-like contender for the top cryptocurrency crown: a blockchain platform that supports applications, systems, and real-life business use cases. It\u2019s a promising technology but, like all the others, has a lot of catching up to do with Ethereum in terms of its network size.\n\nWhat makes Cardano unique is that it is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers, and the platform was built through peer-reviewed research.\n\nCardano performance history: Cardano was cruising along at about $0.10 from its founding in 2017 until early 2021, when it jumped to well over a dollar and was recently trading at around $2. Cardano had weathered the recent crypto market problems better than most, due to being one of the more environmentally friendly cryptocurrency options, but suffered a big fall recently and is now back to around $1.76.\n\nHow to buy Cardano: Cardano can be purchased on Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and many other crypto exchanges.\n\n6. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nDogecoin market cap: $53.1 billion\n\nDogecoin value: $0.41\n\nThe Dogecoin story: Dogecoin bills itself as \u201cthe fun and friendly internet currency.\u201d Launched in 2013 by software developers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a satire of Bitcoin and the exploding popularity of crypto, it\u2019s basically a Bitcoin clone with a cute dog meme for a mascot.\n\nDogecoin has no real use (though some people use it to give small tips on social media), but it\u2019s developed a growing fanbase that\u2019s boosted the price of a Dogecoin from less than a penny a few months ago to about $0.40 today, making it one of the top cryptocurrency performers by market cap if nothing else. Dogecoin also started what is now known as the \u201cmemecoin\u201d space. If you\u2019re looking for the next big memecoin, it could be SafeMoon, which launched in March 2021 and already has over a million users. SafeMoon encourages investors to buy and hold by imposing a 10% fee on anyone who sells their tokens.\n\nDogecoin performance history: In early 2021, Dogecoin crossed the $0.05 threshold for the first time, then went to the moon in April, recently trading at an all-time high of $0.70. It dropped to below $0.45 following Elon Musk's appearance on Saturday Night Live, but climbed today (June 2) following the news that it will be listed on the Coinbase Pro exchange. It is currently worth $0.41.\n\nHow to buy Dogecoin: You can buy Dogecoin on Robinhood and many of the major crypto exchange like Binance and Kraken, but it's not available on Coinbase.\n\n7. XRP/Ripple (XRP)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nXRP/Ripple market cap: $47.3 billion\n\nXRP value: $1.03\n\nThe XRP/Ripple story: XRP\u2019s claim to fame is that it's the fastest digital asset, enabling near real-time global payments anywhere in the world. As such, some payment providers use XRP to expand their reach, lower foreign exchange costs, and settle payments more quickly.\n\nXRP was launched in 2012 by a trio of developers, who then created a private company called OpenCoin, now called Ripple Labs, and gifted it 80 billion XRP. This is what makes XRP unique \u2014 it is, essentially, a for-profit platform, unlike almost every other crypto project in the world.\n\nBuyer beware: in late 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against Ripple and its two cofounders, claiming they raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering (aka XRP). The lawsuit is still unsettled.\n\nXRP performance history: Aside from a blip of a spike in December 2017-January 2018, XRP didn\u2019t crack the $0.60 threshold until 2020. However it's grown throughout April and May is currently trading at just over $1.\n\nHow to buy XRP: The easiest way to purchase XRP is on one of the big crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken.\n\n8. Polkadot (DOT)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nPolkadot market cap: $24.1 billion\n\nPolkadot value: $26.1\n\nThe Polkadot story: Lots of the top cryptocurrency projects have lofty goals, but Polkadot\u2019s is one of the loftiest: to \u201cenable a completely decentralized web where users are in control.\u201d Launched in 2020, Polkadot is the flagship project of the Swiss Web3 foundation. If Web 1.0 was commerce, and Web 2.0 was social, think of Web3 as decentralization. Polkadot\u2019s technology stitches together different blockchains, enabling them to exchange information and transactions and operate together seamlessly.\n\nPolkadot performance history: This crypto was trading at about a nickel until late 2020, when it took off (stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before) and was recently trading at around $41. However a big fall recently has seen it drop back to around $26.\n\nHow to buy Polkadot: Buy Polkadot on major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken.\n\n9. USD Coin (USDC)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nUSD Coin market cap: $22.7 billion\n\nUSD Coin value: $1\n\nThe USD Coin story: Like Tether, USD Coin is a so-called stable coin that's linked to the U.S. dollar. That makes it far less subject to price fluctuations than many other cryptocurrencies \u2014 and indeed, USD Coin has been relatively unaffected by the recent turmoil in the market. USD is also big on transparency, assuring investors that they will be able to withdraw 1 USDC and receive $1 in return.\n\nUSD Coin performance history: USDC is worth $1\n\nHow to buy USD Coin: Buy USD Coin on major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\n10. Uniswap (UNI)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nUniswap market cap: $15.7 billion\n\nUniswap value: $27.7\n\nThe Uniswap story: Most cryptocurrency trading takes place on centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Uniswap, launched in 2018, is a decentralized crytpo exchange that runs on the Ethereum platform \u2014 transaction fees must be paid for in ETH.\n\nThe Uniswap app can swap all different types of tokens but does not connect to the traditional financial network, meaning you can\u2019t convert to USD or Euro or other fiat currencies. (Though you can convert to some stablecoins \u2014 see Tether above.) Uniswap also has its own \u201cgovernance token\u201d: if you own this token, you have a right to vote on the direction of the project\u2019s development. Uniswap recently passed Coinbase in trading volume, and many crypto followers think it could be the future of all exchanges.\n\nUniswap performance history: Launched in 2018, Uniswap hit a high of $42 in late April 2021. It is currently trading at around $27.\n\nHow to buy Uniswap: Buy Uniswap on major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken.\n\n11. Chainlink (LINK)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nChainlink market cap: $13.2 billion\n\nChainlink value: $30.8\n\nThe Chainlink story: Like Ethereum, Chainlink is less a single cryptocurrency but rather a technology that helps underpin the entire crypto structure. Essentially \u2014 and this is necessarily a very stripped-back explanation \u2014 it's a network that enables blockchains to interact with each other and with non-blockchain technologies. You can read more about how it works here. Chainlink also has its own currency, called LINK tokens, of which 1 billion were issued. A total of 35% of these were issued to Node Operators, another 35% were sold to the public and the company retains the remaining 30%.\n\nChainlink performance history: LINK grew steadily from being worth less than a dollar initially to around $12 at the end of 2020. Its soared in 2021 but since came back down, and is currently worth around $31 as of June 2.\n\nHow to buy Chainlink: Buy Chainlink on major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\n12. Internet Computer (ICP)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nInternet Computer market cap: $13.1 billion\n\nInternet Computer value: $106\n\nThe Internet Computer story: Internet Computer only officially launched on May 10, 2021, but it immediately jumped into the Top 10 list of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap. And that's no surprise, because Internet Computer, or ICP, is a big deal. According to CoinMarketCap, it's \"the world\u2019s first blockchain that runs at web speed with unbounded capacity\" and also \"the third major blockchain innovation, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum.\"\n\nBold claims, indeed, but ICP \u2014 which was created by tech startup Dfinity \u2014 is an ambitious project that seeks nothing less than the reinvention of the internet. Around 469 million ICP tokens were issued on its launch, of which approximately 26% are expected to be in circulation.\n\nInternet Computer performance history: ICP enjoyed a stellar launch on the open market, jumping from $0 to $488 in a day. It then fell back sharply, and is currently at around $106.\n\nHow to buy Internet Computer: ICP is already available on Coinbase and is expected to come to Binance and other crypto exchanges soon.\n\n13. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nBitcoin Cash market cap: $13.3 billion\n\nBitcoin Cash value: $700\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash story: Don't be confused by the name, because Bitcoin Cash is a completely different cryptocurrency to Bitcoin. That said, it does owe its existence to the market leader, in that it was created by a group of developers intent on bringing down the cost of Bitcoin transactions. A further split then resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV.\n\nBitcoin Cash performance history: Bitcoin Cash has a lot of catching up to do to Bitcoin in terms of the size of its network. After reaching a high of nearly $4,000 back in 2018, it then dropped considerably and settled to around $300-400 for the next couple of years. A big jump in recent weeks saw it climb back to more than $1,500, but it's been steadily falling since then and and is currently valued at around $700.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin Cash: You can buy Bitcoin Cash on major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken.\n\n14. Litecoin (LTC)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nLitecoin market cap: $12.4 billion\n\nLitecoin value: $186\n\nThe Litecoin story: Litecoin, created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, is one of the earliest Bitcoin clones, aka \u201caltcoins,\u201d and is a well-established crypto. It was developed with a focus on speed, efficiency, and wider initial coin distribution than Bitcoin. For example, Litecoin transactions are confirmed every two and a half minutes, which is four times more frequently than Bitcoin transactions. Another difference: Litecoin has a supply cap of 84 million coins, exactly four times Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014 this is what makes many investors think of Litecoin as the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold.\n\nLitecoin performance history: Litecoin spiked briefly over $300 in late 2017 before dipping as low as $25 in 2019. In late 2020, it began another ascent and recently passed the $400 mark for the first time, although it's since dropped back to around $185.\n\nHow to buy Litecoin: Litecoin can be purchased on any major crypto exchange, as well as on Robinhood and PayPal.\n\n15. Polygon (MATIC)\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nPolygon market cap: $11.3 billion\n\nPolygon value: $1.81\n\nThe Polygon story: Polygon is another cryptocurrency that is far more than just a currency. In fact, Polygon isn't a currency at all \u2014 it's a network which provides a framework for building and connecting blockchains, supported by Ethereum technology. However, it does also have a token, in this case MATIC,\n\nPolygon performance history: As recently as January 2021, MATIC was valued at just $0.19. It shot up over the past few months to a high of $2.63, before falling back to its current value of $1.81\n\nHow to buy Polygon: Buy Polygon on major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nJonathan Lesser is a writer and editor covering cryptocurrency and personal finance.

The move comes after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said last week in a statement that it is necessary to \"crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior\" to prevent the \"transmission of individual risks to the social field.\" Those comments were seen as Beijing's intentions to continue a four-year crackdown on bitcoin trading and other cryptocurrency-related activities. Inner Mongolia's latest draft proposals aim to target companies such as telecommunications and internet firms engaging in virtual currency mining.

But Markus said it is a learning tool for people.\n\n\u201cDoge is very likely the thing this makes someone interested in crypto,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhat they do after that is up to them! But it\u2019s not a threat to the space, it\u2019s quite the opposite,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s helped the space tremendously.\u201d\n\nThis mirrors what Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban told Ellen DeGeneres on \u201cEllen\u201d when he was trying to explain Dogecoin.

Cryptocurrency offers users autonomy, reduces transaction fees, and facilitates quick and easy payments, the clinic pointed out in a press release.\n\nSouthdown Dental provides services to the residents of Mississauga in the Greater Toronto Area, in Canada\u2019s most populous province, Ontario. The clinic, which was established in 1989, takes pride in being an \u201cearly adopter of innovations\u201d in the dental field, utilizing the latest available technologies to provide its patients with the best care. The dental clinic stated:\n\nSeeing the rise in cryptocurrency usage, Southdown Dental is excited to be part of this movement and to meet the rising demand of Canadians for more cryptocurrency acceptance.\n\nThe dental center also admitted that many patients don\u2019t have full coverage for some of the more expensive procedures. And in these unpredictable times, the clinic says, they might want to keep their cash in their bank accounts and spend some of their crypto holdings instead. With the exception of the recent market correction, the value of cryptocurrencies has been on rise since last year.\n\nFrom Regular Checkups to Surgery and Braces \u2013 Patients Can Pay for Everything With Cryptocurrency\n\nSouthdown Dental offers its clients financing, if they need it, different payment plans, and a variety of payment options that now becomes even greater with the addition of crypto payments. The press release did not mention the supported coins but Dr. Kal Khaled, co-owner of the clinic, assured:\n\nWhether it is a regular checkup, a surgical procedure, or braces, our patients will be able to choose traditional payment methods or cryptocurrency going forward.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting shift to be the first Canadian dental clinic to take the leap into a new territory that will offer our patients new options during a very uncertain time,\u201d added his partner, Dr. Bob Vavaroutsos.\n\nAccording to a report by Canadian local news outlet Daily Hive, quoting Coinmap data, Downtown Dental Hygiene Clinic in Toronto also accepts cryptocurrency.

Here's what you need to know", "Article": "Between the meteoric rise of dogecoin accepting bitcoin as payment for its vehicles andall of which happenedin just over a month \u2014 there is growing attention on and interest in the digital asset space.\n\nMainstream adoption of crypto has been gaining steam for years, and was accelerated by the pandemic. Cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, are increasingly seen as investments to hedge against inflation during times of economic uncertainty, much like to gold. And Covid-19 stimulus checks meant some Americans had extra funds to invest\n\nIn 2020, the market of potential bitcoin investors grew to 32 million people in the United States, up 52% from the year prior, according to a survey by digital currency asset management firm Grayscale Investments, published in October . Of the respondents who had bought bitcoin in the preceding four months, 63% said the pandemic impacted their decision to invest.\n\nThere has also been more institutional acceptance of crypto recently, which increases awareness and trust among retail investors.\n\n\"Because it's been around for longer people are starting to accept it,\" Gavin Smith, Group CEO of crypto investment firm Panxora, told CNN Business. \"That's led to professional involvement because now they understand a bit better how to manage the risk,\" Gavin Smith, Group CEO of crypto investment firm Panxora, told CNN Business. That's creating more confidence from the general public, he added.\n\nBut for new investors in the space, some caution and education is needed, experts say.\n\n\"Crypto is not for the faint of heart,\" said R.A. Farrokhnia, Columbia Business School professor and executive director of the Columbia Fintech Initiative . For investors who do want to invest in cryptocurrency, \"you have to take a very conscientious and disciplined approach,\" he said.\n\nWhich cryptocurrency should I buy?\n\nThere is a wide variety of digital tokens and other crypto-related projects that one could invest in \u2014 with more emerging all the time as the so-called decentralized finance (or \"DeFi\") movement gains traction.\n\n\"Many digital currencies have distinct use cases, and you should understand the value proposition of a potential investment before committing capital,\" Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an email.\n\nFor novice crypto investors, it's probably best to start with the larger, more established options , such as bitcoin and ethereum. While still highly volatile, the regulatory framework around them is clearer than with other tokens, which could help temper future risk.\n\nBitcoin is also the most liquid cryptocurrency, which should make it easier for investors to buy and sell with relative ease, compared to smaller, more niche coins with less demand, Farrokhnia said.\n\nAfter starting with the usual suspects, Panxora's Smith said, invvestors should do some research \"then maybe branch out into some of the other tokens that offer specific use cases in decentralized finance ... There's a few tokens out there that are really exciting and quite small at the moment.\"\n\nHow do you buy it?\n\nKeep it simple.\n\nStick with well-known, regulated exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken or Binance, to buy and hold crypto investments \u2014 at least to begin with.\n\nDigital wallets that allow a person to hold crypto without the involvement of an intermediary are often associated with crypto and considered a perk of the decentralized finance space. But these \"non-custodial\" wallets come with unique security risks, such as the possibility of losing your password and losing access to your funds with no hope of regaining it (for a cautionary tale, read about these would-be bitcoin millionaires who lost their fortunes this way).\n\n\"With bitcoin, while it's on the exchange, you're quite safe,\" Smith said. \"Until you get familiar with the technology, I wouldn't recommend holding in your own wallet.\"\n\nOne thing to note: Crypto exchanges often have higher transaction fees than many stock trading apps, Farrokhnia said.\n\nAs for when to invest, experts advise against trying to time the market or buying a certain token just because the internet is buzzing about it. (FOMO is not a good investment strategy). Instead, many recommend the dollar cost averaging tactic, which entails buying smaller amounts at regular intervals over a set period of time.\n\n\"Dollar cost averaging is a great tactic for investors who want to invest and hold digital currencies over the long term,\" Smith said.\n\nHow risky is it, really?\n\nCryptocurrency is still quite risky compared with most other asset classes.\n\n\"For an average investor with a few thousand dollars of savings, this may not be the best domain to invest your money,\" Farrokhnia said.\n\nThe price of most mainstream cryptocurrencies isn't pegged to something specific and observable, in the way that stock prices typically fluctuate with the fundamental performance of a company. That can make it hard to understand or predict the current or future trajectory of a digital coin.\n\nFor this reason, experts recommend allocating only a small portion of your total investment portfolio (if any) to crypto.\n\nBut for some, the higher risk could be attractive because it may mean higher reward.\n\n\"The volatility inherent in the asset class makes crypto a riskier asset than most equities, but it comes with higher potential upside. Many digital currencies, including bitcoin, offer superior risk-adjusted returns over time,\" Grayscale's Sonnenshein said. He added: \"Bitcoin may not be for everyone, but everyone should at least consider it.\"", "Link": "https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/04/investing/cryptocurrency-how-to-invest/index.html", "Authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "Image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210503143837-01-cryptocurrency-0416-super-tease.jpg", "Date": "04 May, 2021"}, {"index": 60, "Headline": "Companies need to be careful with accounting for crypto", "Article": "As businesses invest funds in cryptocurrencies and sell assets like nonfungible tokens, they should be aware of the accounting and tax issues surrounding them, or risk running afoul of regulators.\n\nWith corporations like MicroStrategy investing billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies, more companies are considering incorporating crypto into their business operations. The use of crypto presents opportunities and challenges for businesses, but as with any new frontier, there are some unknown dangers, along with enticing incentives. A new paper from Deloitte, Corporates Using Crypto , offers companies an overview of the types of questions and insights they should consider as they determine whether and how to use crypto, including issues related to corporate treasury, strategy, operations, risk, compliance, accounting and tax.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more and more corporates recognizing that as retail customers become more comfortable with holding cryptocurrencies, they are looking for other avenues to use that, rather than just investing in it,\u201d said Tim Davis, a risk and financial advisory principal at Deloitte & Touche. \u201cRetail-based companies don\u2019t want to limit a customer that would prefer to pay in crypto by saying, 'We\u2019re only going to accept payment in regular [currency.]' Some of that is making sure they\u2019re providing the broadest possible outreach to how customers want to pay for the products and services.\u201d\n\n\n\nConcept Of Bitcoin Like A Computer Processor On Motherboard. 3D Scene. Picasa/3dsculptor - Fotolia\n\nAs the value of assets like Bitcoin and Dogecoin rise, customers aren\u2019t likely to pay in those cryptocurrencies. But there are other forms of crypto known as stablecoin, which try to peg their value to some external reference like a national currency, and so are less subject to volatility.\n\n\u201cObviously when you\u2019re in a particular asset class like Bitcoin, the theory is that it will continue to rise in value,\u201d said Davis. \u201cIt does not make sense for a customer to pay in an asset that\u2019s going to increase in price. It just means you\u2019re going to pay more for something than you would have otherwise. So while that dynamic is out there, with cryptocurrencies increasing in value, I think you will see more and more customers preferring to pay in some kind of stablecoin. There are many different varieties of them. Stablecoins are also becoming an important piece of the basket of currencies when we\u2019re talking about how corporates can accept payments for that reason.\u201d\n\nCompanies also want to get into the crypto trend to show customers they\u2019re not falling behind their competitors. \u201cThey may decide to take it as a form of payment from their customer ... simply because it sounds cool,\u201d said Rob Massey, global tax and blockchain assets leader at Deloitte Tax. \u201cThey want to be viewed as progressive. Quickly what they find out is there are a number of customers out there who would like to pay in stablecoin or crypto. There may be vendors that want to be paid in crypto or stablecoin. And then that begins the journey of how commerce is evolving.\u201d\n\nCompanies that want to get involved in the crypto world need to make sure they have the tax and accounting systems in place to handle it. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of people that believe it\u2019s not too far out anymore that we can actually start using smart contracts and programmable money to elevate commerce,\u201d said Massey. \u201cIf you think it\u2019s not too far out, then why not start to engage in using crypto as a method of payment now, just in terms of readiness.\u201d\n\nCrypto can be complicated from a tax perspective. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re using something that is not fiat, then you\u2019re realizing a gain or a loss from a tax perspective every time you use it, because the value that it has when you use it is probably different than your basis, so that triggers a gain or loss,\u201d said Massey. \u201cThat does bring some complexity. We\u2019re not used to a world of barter transactions. That\u2019s kind of what it is for tax, because you\u2019re using property of some kind that\u2019s moving in value for property and services. Every time you\u2019re using it, you\u2019re triggering a gain or loss. Think about going through all of your accounting cycles and making sure that you\u2019re tracking it when you\u2019re using it for payroll, for a vendor, or for a customer. Then it requires a different level of tracking and frankly hygiene throughout your systems to make sure you catch it.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, companies may want to use a reputable intermediary to process the payments for them. \u201cThe first decision they\u2019ve really go to make is do they actually want to be accepting crypto themselves and holding it, or do they want to engage the services of an intermediary, who will essentially be cashing out the crypto for them, taking a fee and paying them in fiat,\u201d said Davis. \u201cBoth of them are options, and there are service providers to provide that type of service. Obviously if you\u2019re utilizing a third party, then you want to do some due diligence, that this company has got the controls to be doing it effectively because you have some customer relationship risk that you\u2019re ceding to this third party, but you also have some compliance risk as well. If you\u2019re accepting money in crypto, you at least have a responsibility to the Office of Foreign Access Control to make sure that you\u2019re not accepting from what would otherwise be on a sanctioned or restricted list. Even if you\u2019re not a financial institution, if you\u2019re accepting crypto for payment, you still have that responsibility at a minimum when it comes to accepting payment.\u201d\n\nCompanies need to be careful that they\u2019re not being tricked into a money laundering scheme by accepting crypto payments. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a risk I think all companies need to be concerned with, but it\u2019s typically businesses where there\u2019s an inflow and outflow that represent a much greater risk for money laundering,\u201d said Davis. \u201cA casino, as an example, might be one where it provides the money launderer the opportunity to launder the money and get the proceeds back. If you were buying a car, it\u2019s a little more difficult because you probably have to then go sell the car to get the proceeds laundered, and I think it\u2019s unlikely that most launderers would go to all that effort. It\u2019s not impossible, but they are likely to choose easier ways to do it.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the Department of Justice issued a cryptocurrency enforcement framework last year to indicate which kinds of businesses might be prone to such activity. \u201cIn that document, it laid out those businesses that it believes are at high risk when it comes to crypto transactions and the likelihood that there\u2019s money laundering going on,\u201d said Davis. \u201cYou\u2019d probably want to pay attention to those types of entities and have some sort of risk-based decisioning on how and when you\u2019d accept money from those kinds of entities and, if so, what additional checks and balances you might want to put in place.\u201d\n\nNFT accounting\n\nAccountants need to take note of price fluctuations in the crypto market, which can be different from how it works with regular currency. \u201cThere are instances where you\u2019re dealing in something, if you\u2019re going to contract in a digital asset, a cryptocurrency which is moving in value, what does that do? It really creates potentially a derivative, which is different,\u201d said Massey.\n\nThe auction of a work of art in the form of a nonfungible token, or NFT, by the artist Beeple in March by Christie\u2019s for $69 million raised awareness of the intersection of cryptocurrency and real currency. \u201cTraditional crypto is one thing, and it\u2019s continuing now with NFTs, which have a lot of popularity now,\u201d said Massey. \u201cWhat can nonfungible tokens do? We\u2019re seeing them across a lot of different industries, in sports, media, and entertainment, even traditional financial services.\u201d\n\nSome companies are offering to pay their employees and directors in cryptocurrency, which could increase the use of NFTs. \u201cSome of that is driven by the company just wanting to promote the asset class,\u201d said Davis. \u201cSome of it is coming from the individual who is saying, \u2018If I had a choice, I\u2019d rather be paid in crypto than in fiat.\u2019 You\u2019ve got online businesses that are increasingly looking at ways in which they could have their own tokens that are within their own ecosystem, and they might even have a rewards component. You\u2019re creating some type of customer loyalty by rewarding them with some additional tokens. They can then exchange those tokens for other things in the environment. It might be a gaming platform or a social media platform, where you can create your own e-commerce environment on your own coin, and then possibly give the individual some ability to then cash out of the coin. It has this utility where you can actually do things like create customer loyalty with owning a token associated with that particular brand. It just has that additional benefit that fiat doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nSome NFT owners have found that they couldn\u2019t even access the NFT once it was purchased, and the accounting for an NFT is likely to be complex. \u201cI think the accounting treatment is going to be dictated based on the type of entity that holds it,\u201d said Massey. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get to a different answer for corporate versus an issuer versus an investment company, and then you also have considerations about what it is you\u2019ve invested in. Not all NFTs are created equal, just like not all crypto is created equal. What it represents is going to bear weight in the accounting treatment as well as tax.\u201d\n\nNFTs might be treated like other collectibles. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the next evolution of baseball cards,\u201d said Davis. \u201cYou collected it because of your love of the game, not because you were hoping to make some profit on it in the future. ... It\u2019s not so much an investment vehicle. But you have to think through the platform that you\u2019re going to use to provide it, make sure it\u2019s going to be there for the customer when they need it, and you probably need some kind of backup option, so if it\u2019s being kept on someone\u2019s phone and the phone gets lost, they can come back to you, authenticate themselves, and get their copy back again. It\u2019s still early days, and we\u2019re just starting to see the emergence of some of these marketplaces and portals, but it\u2019s signaling the start of a trend that we\u2019re going to see much more of is this ability to own things and to have the creator of that, the artist or producer, put some rights and conditions over that.\u201d\n\nThe use of NFTs is likely to raise accounting and tax issues, but Massey had some advice. \"Think about, first of all, what is it that they\u2019ve created or bought? Then what does it represent when it\u2019s sold? Is it really a sale or a license? Sometimes the sale of an NFT is more akin to a perpetual license than it is an actual transfer of a copyrighted thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s questions in there that would impact both the tax and the accounting treatment. It\u2019s also the sourcing. How do you source a transaction? There\u2019s really interesting questions around indirect taxes, like the sales tax or the VAT around the world. There are things like information reporting, 1099s, so as we go down to these new concepts and increasingly marketplaces, where people can either issue or sell for the first time or resell, then it\u2019s important for the accountants to step in. It\u2019s all of our normal list of things we would consider, but it all starts with what is it that we\u2019re transacting with? What is the property? What is the NFT and then what is the transaction? We tend to get involved in these really interesting conversations with innovative new models and take a step back. Here we are, the bean counters. Let\u2019s figure out what it is.\u201d\n\nSEC and FASB standard-setting\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is also keeping a close eye on the crypto market, although public companies still haven\u2019t waded in too deeply yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early days, and we as yet haven\u2019t seen a lot of evidence of widespread use of digital assets, notwithstanding some fairly recent one-off significant transactions, but beyond that we haven\u2019t seen widespread use of it,\u201d said SEC chief accountant Paul Munter during Baruch College\u2019s financial reporting conference last week. \u201cThere are some huge scoping issues here because not all digital assets are the same. A lot of times, people pose the question assuming we\u2019re just talking about Bitcoin, but in reality the spectrum of digital assets is very broad and continues to evolve. If we were to think about a standard-setting solution, it has to start with a question of scope. What exactly do we mean by digital assets? What kinds of things are we contemplating? How would we scope it in a fashion that not only would be fit for purpose for the type of digital assets that exist now, but that may exist in the not too distant future? Beyond that, who are we talking about? Where in the digital asset space are we trying to develop guidance for? Is it the holders? Is it the miners? Is it the broker-dealer type entities, etc.?\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Richard Jones, said at the same conference that FASB decided not to add a project on digital assets to its agenda this year. \u201cWhen we looked at it, we didn\u2019t see a lot of diversity in practice in the accounting for similar items,\u201d he explained. \"We also saw that there was an AICPA paper out there that I think does a great job of explaining particularly the intangible asset model and how it would be applied to digital assets that qualify as intangibles. Finally when we think about our agenda, it's not just what would be a good accounting question to answer, but we also look at prevalence and to date we haven\u2019t seen that broad prevalence. Certainly there are some big names that have some presence in this space, but we didn\u2019t see that broad material presence that meant it should be at the top of our standard-setting agenda.\u201d", "Link": "https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/companies-need-to-be-careful-with-accounting-for-crypto", "Authors": ["Picasa - Fotolia", "Editor-In-Chief"], "Image": "https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ffd9503/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6200x3255+0+349/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2F40%2F7945e5934f7f9ad24e1e534ded83%2Fbitcoindigital.jpg", "Date": "12 May, 2021"}, {"index": 61, "Headline": "Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo Unveil Their Cryptocurrency Policies \u2013 News Bitcoin News", "Article": "Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo Unveil Their Cryptocurrency Policies\n\nBank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo have shared their policies regarding cryptocurrency before the U.S. Senate banking committee.

The committee, headed by Senator Sherrod Brown, summoned the investment bankers for its annual oversight hearing on Wall Street firms.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said that BofA was keeping distance from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the bank continued \u201cto evaluate the opportunities, risks and client demand for products and services related to cryptocurrency.\u201d Noting that his bank holds more than 60 blockchain-related patents, he emphasized, \u201cWe still have not found a use case at scale.\u201d The Bank of America executive confirmed:\n\nCurrently, we do not lend against cryptocurrencies and do not bank companies whose primary business is cryptocurrency or the facilitation of cryptocurrency trading and investment.\n\nBank of America\u2019s analyst said in January that bitcoin was the \u201cmother of all bubbles.\u201d Nonetheless, the bank\u2019s most recent fund manager survey saw \u201clong bitcoin\u201d as the most crowded trade.

Is it better than Doge?", "Article": "There\u2019s a new hot cryptocurrency gathering investors\u2019 attention instead of Dogecoin. It\u2019s called Safemoon, and it has all the looks of what made Dogecoin popular in the first place.\n\nThe rise of Safemoon\n\nDogecoin has suffered in recent days from a bumpy ride with investors. The darling Dogecoin was getting all sorts of attention leading up to Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d After Musk called Dogecoin a \u201chustle\u201d on \u201cSNL,\u201d investors sold their holdings, leading to a quick drop in Dogecoin\u2019s value.\n\nSo, experts have turned to the cryptocurrency Safemoon as a potential investment opportunity. Per Yahoo! Finance, Safemoon is worth around $0.000007, giving it huge room to grow in value if more people invest,\n\nThis is similar to Dogecoin\u2019s original rise. As the Deseret News reported, Dogecoin was worth $0.0023 back in July before spiking to $0.70 in the last few weeks. That doesn\u2019t sound like a lot at first. But when you invest a lot of money into it, the slight spikes can lead to huge gains over time if you\u2019re lucky and if the market works in your favor, experts say. Nothing is guaranteed.\n\nSo what is Safemoon?\n\nSafemoon is a new cryptocurrency with almost no history. According to Benzinga, Safemoon began trading in March at $0.000000001 per Safemoon coin. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value jumped to $0.000012 before dropping back down to $0.000004. That\u2019s a 1,000% gain in a few months.\n\nSafemooon \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any clear use cases,\u201d though, according to Benzinga. This means you can\u2019t use it to buy real things yet.\n\nIs Safemoon a scheme?\n\nPossibly. According to Benzinga, Safemoon resembles \u201ca pyramid scheme instead of a sound monetary policy\u201d since investors are charged a 10% fee when they sell their holdings. And 5% of that fee is given back to other Safemoon investors.\n\n\u201cEssentially, investors rely on more people buying into Safemoon to increase their investment,\u201d according to Benzinga.\n\nSo what\u2019s the deal? Should you invest? Well, it sounds a little sketchy. But, per Benzinga, \u201cmost investors would agree that Safemoon has higher potential for returns than DOGE, albeit an extremely high risk investment.\u201d", "Link": "https://www.deseret.com/2021/5/11/22430356/dogecoin-safemoon-cryptocurrency-predictions", "Authors": ["Herb Scribner", "Sarah Todd", "Jay Drew", "Ryan Mcdonald", "Carter Williams", "May"], "Image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6SVOHi10qoBgJt9VXEY0X1Hh5i8=/0x680:9504x5656/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476220/AP21089552118817.jpg", "Date": "11 May, 2021"}, {"index": 63, "Headline": "NYU's 'dean of valuation' argues ether has a better chance of becoming a commodity than bitcoin", "Article": "The cryptocurrency ether \"has a better shot\" at becoming a commodity than bitcoin, argues New York University's Aswath Damodaran.\n\n\"If the future lies in blockchain transactions \u2014 and ether is going to be a better lubricant of those blockchain transactions \u2014 you could actually argue that ether has a stronger upside story than bitcoin does,\" Damodaran, a professor of finance at NYU's Stern School of Business, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Thursday.\n\nEther is the cryptocurrency that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

He said that his own personal advice to people is to \u201cstay away\u201d from cryptocurrencies. However, his bank, JPMorgan, will not stay away as clients want exposure to this asset class.\n\nJamie Dimon\u2019s Personal Advice to Investors About Bitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nJamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., gave his congressional testimony before the House of Financial Services Committee regarding cryptocurrency on Thursday. While admitting that JPMorgan\u2019s clients are interested in investing in bitcoin, Dimon said:\n\nMy own personal advice to people is stay away from it. That does not mean the clients don\u2019t want it. This goes back to how you have to run a business. I don\u2019t smoke marijuana but if you make it nationally legal, I\u2019m not going to stop our people from banking it.\n\n\u201cWe are debating should we make it available in some way, in a safe way, that people can buy and sell it\u201d and put it in their financial statements and balance sheets, the JPMorgan CEO continued. \u201cBut my own personal view, it\u2019s nothing like a fiat currency. It\u2019s nothing like gold. Buyer beware.\u201d\n\nDimon clarified that his statements only apply to cryptocurrencies, not blockchains or stablecoins, which are \u201csupported by assets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe JPMorgan boss further emphasized that his personal views do not influence the financial services that JPMorgan Chase offers to its clients. \u201cA lot of our clients are asking, \u2018can we help them buy or sell cryptocurrency?\u201d Dimon said at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s annual shareholder meeting last week. \u201cAnd we\u2019re investing in that as we speak.\u201d\n\nThe JPMorgan executive further said during his congressional testimony Thursday:\n\nI don\u2019t tell people how to spend their money, regardless of how I might personally feel about something.\n\nReiterating his view expressed in April that cryptocurrencies are emerging issues that need to be dealt with quickly, Dimon said in his congressional testimony that the crypto asset class could benefit from more regulation.\n\n\u201cI do think that eventually the regulators who are a day late and a dollar short should be paying a lot more attention to the future, like payment for the order flow, a high-frequency trading, cryptocurrency, and put a legal regulatory framework around it,\u201d he opined.\n\nDimon has long been a bitcoin skeptic. He called the cryptocurrency a fraud back in September 2017. Now JPMorgan is slowly getting into the crypto space. In March, the bank launched a crypto investment product tracking public company stocks with bitcoin exposure. The bank is also reportedly working on providing clients access to bitcoin investments.\n\nJPMorgan recently highlighted three reasons for investing in bitcoin after its analysts predicted that the price of the cryptocurrency could reach $146K as its competition with gold heats up. The firm subsequently lowered its bitcoin price estimate to $130K but said that clients can put 1% of their portfolios in BTC. Last week, JPMorgan initiated coverage of the Coinbase stock with an overweight rating and a 60% upside from the current price.\n\nWhat do you think about Jamie Dimon\u2019s personal advice to investors about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?
