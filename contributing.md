So, you decided to contribute an algorithm or some set of codes that is written in Python, here is a guideline to open your pull request and get it merged at early.

## Important Guidelines 

### How Can I Contribute?

There are ways you can contribute to this repo,

 -
### Here are some guidelines on those.

Moving ahead with PRs

### The guidelines for your PRs to be submitted are easy and simple

- Add a folder and name it something cool for example if you are adding an algorithm to check person's age using OpenCV 2.0 name your folder as ``Age Checker Via OpenCV``
- Add a readme file stating how it works and the prerequisites (if any) and a ``Requirement.txt`` if your script uses some 3rd Party packages. 
- Add your script to that folder 
- Open a PR with the name of your folder (as here the PR would be called ``Age Checker Via OpenCV`` and add a two line description on what it does. 
- That's it the maintainers will review your code, ask for changes (if any) and if everything is in order, merge it.
