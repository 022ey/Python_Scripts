## Invite your bot
So, you finally made a bot but it's not on any server? Don't worry, we got your back, jack.
	-- 1.  Make sure you’re logged on to the  [Discord website](https://discord.com/).
	-- 2. Navigate to the  [application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
-- 3.  Click on your bot’s page.
-- 4.  Go to the “OAuth2” tab.
-- 5. Tick the “bot” checkbox under “scopes”.
-- 6. Tick the permissions required for your bot to function under “Bot Permissions”.

> -   Please be aware of the consequences of requiring your bot to have the “Administrator” permission.
>     
> -   Bot owners must have 2FA enabled for certain actions and permissions when added in servers that have Server-Wide 2FA enabled. Check the  [2FA support page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication)  for more information.

-- 7. 1.  Now the resulting URL can be used to add your bot to a server. Copy and paste the URL into your browser, choose a server to invite the bot to, and click “Authorize”.
