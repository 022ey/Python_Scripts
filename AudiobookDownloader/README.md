# Audiobook Downloader and Player
Python script to download audiobooks by name directly from audiobooklabs.com along with a GUI player attached.  

Works on as expected on windows and Linux.

Supposed to work on MacOs but a lot of glitches ;-;

The script has the following imports (given in requirements.txt)

requests

beautifulsoup4

audioplayer

PyObjC (for MacOS)

All of these can be installed by using 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These are the screenshots (Garuda Linux) :
